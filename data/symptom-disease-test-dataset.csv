"The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years. But for some people, signs and symptoms develop suddenly. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: GH GH  Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as:  Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding  Men may also have symptoms such as:  Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: TSH  Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: ACTH  Severe fatigue Low blood pressure, which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion  Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: ADH  Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances  Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding.",507

"Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. They typically occur with a medical problem. Symptoms often come and go during the day. There may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital. Primary symptoms include the following. Reduced awareness of surroundings This may result in:  Trouble focusing on a topic or changing topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions Being easily distracted Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings  Poor thinking skills This may appear as:  Poor memory, such as forgetting recent events Not knowing where they are or who they are Trouble with speech or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Trouble reading or writing  Behavior and emotional changes These may include:  Anxiety, fear or distrust of others Depression A short temper or anger A sense of feeling elated Lack of interest and emotion Quick changes in mood Personality changes Seeing things that others don't see Being restless, anxious or combative Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults Slowed movement or being sluggish Changes in sleep habits A switched night-day sleep-wake cycle  Types of delirium Experts have identified three types:  Hyperactive delirium. This may be the easiest type to recognize. People with this type may be restless and pace the room. They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. People with this type often resist care. Hypoactive delirium. People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. They might seem to be in a daze. They don't interact with family or others. Mixed delirium. Symptoms involve both types of delirium. The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish.  Delirium and dementia Delirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years. Delirium often occurs in people with dementia. However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include:  Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time — within a day or two. Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. Rapid changes in symptoms. Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level.

"There are three general types of thoracic outlet syndrome:  Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome. This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known as an aneurysm.  It's possible to have a mix of the three different types of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple parts of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, signs and symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:  Numbness or tingling in your arm or fingers Pain or aches in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand Weakening grip  Signs and symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include:  Discoloration of your hand (bluish color) Arm pain and swelling Blood clot in veins in the upper area of your body Arm fatigue with activity Paleness or abnormal color in one or more fingers or your hand Throbbing lump near your collarbone  Signs and symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:  Cold fingers, hands or arms Hand and arm pain Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your fingers or your entire hand Weak or no pulse in the affected arm ",981

"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include:  Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.

"There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound. How twins are joined Conjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. Each pair of conjoined twins is unique. Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:  Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs. Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare. Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.  In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu).",243

"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms. When they do, signs and symptoms can include:  Stomach ulcers Heartburn Diabetes Weakness Fatigue Muscle cramps Indigestion Diarrhea Weight loss Skin rash Constipation Pain in your abdomen or back Yellowing of your skin or eyes Low blood sugar  Causes It's not clear what causes most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occur when hormone-producing cells in the pancreas (islet cells) develop changes (mutations) in their DNA — the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body. DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions. One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells. Sometimes the cancer cells break away and spread to other organs, such as the liver. Some inherited syndromes increase the risk of this type of cancer, including:  Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau disease Von Recklinghausen's disease (neurofibromatosis 1) Tuberous sclerosis  Risk factors Factors that are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors include:  Being male. Men are much more likely than women to develop these tumors. A family history of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. If a family member was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, your risk is increased. You may have multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome, which increases the risk of this type of tumor.

"Children get the same types of headaches adults do, but their symptoms may be a little different. For example, migraine pain in adults often lasts at least four hours — but in children, the pain may not last as long. Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can't describe symptoms. In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently into certain categories. Migraine Migraines can cause:  Pulsating or throbbing head pain Pain that worsens with activity Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Extreme sensitivity to light and sound  Even infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry or rock back and forth to indicate severe pain. Tension-type headache Tension-type headaches can cause:  A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head Pain that's not worsened by physical activity Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine  Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days. Cluster headache Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually:  Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation  Chronic daily headache Doctors use the phrase ""chronic daily headache"" (CDH) for migraines and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month. CDH may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications — even nonprescription pain medications — too often.",444

"Signs and symptoms of a tension-type headache include:  Dull, aching head pain Sensation of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles  Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic. Episodic tension-type headaches Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches may become chronic. Chronic tension-type headaches This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be continuous. If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic. Tension-type headaches versus migraines Tension-type headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines. Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you can also have migraines. Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse. An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension-type headache, but this symptom isn't common.",974

"If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you:  Prefer being alone and choose to do activities alone Don't want or enjoy close relationships Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships Feel like you can't experience pleasure Have difficulty expressing emotions and reacting appropriately to situations May seem humorless, indifferent or emotionally cold to others May appear to lack motivation and goals Don't react to praise or critical remarks from others  Schizoid personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood, though some features may be noticeable during childhood. These features may cause you to have trouble functioning well in school, a job, socially or in other areas of life. However, you may do reasonably well in your job if you mostly work alone. Schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia Although a different disorder, schizoid personality disorder can have some similar symptoms to schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, such as a severely limited ability to make social connections and a lack of emotional expression. People with these disorders may be viewed as odd or eccentric. Even though the names may sound similar, unlike schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, people with schizoid personality disorder:  Are in touch with reality, so they're unlikely to experience paranoia or hallucinations Make sense when they speak (although the tone may not be lively), so they don't have conversational patterns that are strange and hard to follow  When to see a doctor People with schizoid personality disorder usually only seek treatment for a related problem, such as depression. If someone close to you has urged you to seek help for symptoms common to schizoid personality disorder, make an appointment with a health care or mental health professional. If you suspect a loved one may have schizoid personality disorder, gently suggest that the person seek medical attention. It might help to offer to go along to the first appointment.",881

"Signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops gradually and produces symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the disease may be discovered only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. General symptoms Sarcoidosis can begin with these signs and symptoms:  Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Weight loss Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles  Lung symptoms Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as:  Persistent dry cough Shortness of breath Wheezing Chest pain  Skin symptoms Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include:  A rash of red or reddish-purple bumps, usually located on the shins or ankles, which may be warm and tender to the touch Disfiguring sores (lesions) on the nose, cheeks and ears Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color Growths under the skin (nodules), particularly around scars or tattoos  Eye symptoms Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it's important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye signs and symptoms do occur, they may include:  Blurred vision Eye pain Burning, itching or dry eyes Severe redness Sensitivity to light  Heart symptoms      Cardiac sarcoidosis: A heart under attack   Click here for an infographic to learn more        Cardiac sarcoidosis: A heart under attack   Click here for an infographic to learn more Signs and symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include:  Chest pain Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) Rapid or fluttering heart beat (palpitations) Swelling caused by excess fluid (edema)  Sarcoidosis can also affect calcium metabolism, the nervous system, the liver and spleen, muscles, bones and joints, the kidneys, lymph nodes, or any other organ.",875

"Most thyroid nodules don't cause signs or symptoms. But occasionally some nodules become so large that they can:  Be felt Be seen, often as a swelling at the base of your neck Press on your windpipe or esophagus, causing shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing  In some cases, thyroid nodules produce additional thyroxine, a hormone secreted by your thyroid gland. The extra thyroxine can cause symptoms of an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism), such as:  Unexplained weight loss Increased sweating Tremor Nervousness Rapid or irregular heartbeat  Only a small number of thyroid nodules are cancerous.

Possible symptoms include severe pain in or around one eye or on one side of your head. There may be tearing, nasal stuffiness and a runny nostril on the affected side of the head. A cluster headache strikes quickly, usually without warning, although you might first have migraine-like nausea and aura. Common signs and symptoms during a headache include:  Excruciating pain that is generally situated in, behind or around one eye, but may radiate to other areas of your face, head and neck One-sided pain Restlessness Excessive tearing Redness of your eye on the affected side Stuffy or runny nose on the affected side Forehead or facial sweating on the affected side Pale skin (pallor) or flushing on your face Swelling around your eye on the affected side Drooping eyelid on the affected side  People with cluster headache, unlike those with migraine, are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. Some migraine-like symptoms — including sensitivity to light and sound — can occur with a cluster headache, though usually on one side. Cluster period characteristics A cluster period generally lasts for several weeks to months. The starting date and the duration of each cluster period might be consistent from period to period. For example, cluster periods can occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall. Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period lasting 3 months or longer before another cluster headache develops. Chronic cluster periods might continue for more than a year, or pain-free periods might last less than one month. During a cluster period:  Headaches usually occur every day, sometimes several times a day A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours The attacks often occur at the same time each day Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after you go to bed  The pain usually ends as suddenly as it began, with rapidly decreasing intensity. After attacks, most people are pain-free but exhausted.",225

"The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include:  Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. Organ meats. Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.  Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include:  Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. Wheezing or shortness of breath. Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.  The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.",36

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:  Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.  Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:  Withdrawal from friends and family A drop in performance at school Trouble sleeping Irritability or depressed mood Lack of motivation  Also, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be:  Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations ",882

Signs and symptoms include:  Bleeding easily Bruising easily Fatigue Poor appetite Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Dark-colored urine Itchy skin Fluid buildup in your abdomen (ascites) Swelling in your legs Weight loss Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy) Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas)  Every chronic hepatitis C infection starts with an acute phase. Acute hepatitis C usually goes undiagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms. When signs and symptoms are present, they may include jaundice, along with fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches. Acute symptoms appear one to three months after exposure to the virus and last two weeks to three months. Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic. Some people clear HCV from their bodies after the acute phase, an outcome known as spontaneous viral clearance. In studies of people diagnosed with acute HCV, rates of spontaneous viral clearance have varied from 15% to 25%. Acute hepatitis C also responds well to antiviral therapy.",466

"Adults and children who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is known as ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. LDL This excess cholesterol is sometimes deposited in certain portions of the skin, some tendons and around the iris of the eyes:  Skin. The most common spots for cholesterol deposits to occur is on the hands, elbows and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes. Tendons. Cholesterol deposits may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendons in the hands. Eyes. High cholesterol levels can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia.  Causes Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene alteration that's passed down from one or both parents. People who have this condition are born with it. This change prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease. Risk factors The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parents have the gene alteration that causes it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including:  Ashkenazi Jews Some Lebanese groups French Canadians  Complications People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age. Heart attacks may occur before age 50 in men and age 60 in women. The rarer and more severe variety of the condition, if undiagnosed or untreated, can cause death before age 20.

"Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel. Hypomanic symptoms Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include:  An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Irritable or agitated behavior Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Tendency to be easily distracted Inability to concentrate  Depressive symptoms Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include:  Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Irritability, especially in children and teenagers Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Sleep problems Restlessness Fatigue or feeling slowed down Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide ",263

"Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease dementia. But unlike Alzheimer's disease, the most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss. Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include:  Confusion Trouble paying attention and concentrating Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others Slowed thinking Difficulty with organization Difficulty deciding what to do next Problems with memory Restlessness and agitation Unsteady gait Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine Depression or apathy  Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia. Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia. But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia. What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together. Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.",1048

"There are four main types of diabetic neuropathy. You can have one type or more than one type of neuropathy. Your symptoms depend on the type you have and which nerves are affected. Usually, symptoms develop gradually. You may not notice anything is wrong until considerable nerve damage has occurred. Peripheral neuropathy This type of neuropathy may also be called distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy. It's the most common type of diabetic neuropathy. It affects the feet and legs first, followed by the hands and arms. Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night, and may include:  Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes Tingling or burning feeling Sharp pains or cramps Muscle weakness Extreme sensitivity to touch — for some people, even a bedsheet's weight can be painful Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint damage  Autonomic neuropathy The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, eyes, bladder, digestive system and sex organs. Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing signs and symptoms including:  A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycemia unawareness) Drops in blood pressure when rising from sitting or lying down that may cause dizziness or fainting (orthostatic hypotension) Bladder or bowel problems Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis), causing nausea, vomiting, sensation of fullness and loss of appetite Difficulty swallowing Changes in the way the eyes adjust from light to dark or far to near Increased or decreased sweating Problems with sexual response, such as vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men  Proximal neuropathy (diabetic polyradiculopathy) This type of neuropathy often affects nerves in the thighs, hips, buttocks or legs. It can also affect the abdominal and chest area. Symptoms are usually on one side of the body, but may spread to the other side. Proximal neuropathy may include:  Severe pain in the buttock, hip or thigh Weak and shrinking thigh muscles Difficulty rising from a sitting position Chest or abdominal wall pain  Mononeuropathy (focal neuropathy) Mononeuropathy refers to damage to a single, specific nerve. The nerve may be in the face, torso, arm or leg. Mononeuropathy may lead to:  Difficulty focusing or double vision Paralysis on one side of the face Numbness or tingling in the hand or fingers Weakness in the hand that may result in dropping things Pain in the shin or foot Weakness causing difficulty lifting the front part of the foot (foot drop) Pain in the front of the thigh ",291

"The severity of signs and symptoms of radiation sickness depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. Signs and symptoms are also affected by the type of exposure — such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. Initial signs and symptoms The initial signs and symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of signs and symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no apparent illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms. If you've had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before any signs and symptoms begin. But with severe exposure, signs and symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure. Possible symptoms include:  Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Headache Fever Dizziness and disorientation Weakness and fatigue Hair loss Bloody vomit and stools from internal bleeding Infections Low blood pressure ",835

"The signs and symptoms of aspergillosis vary with the type of illness you develop: Allergic reaction Some people with asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold. Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include:  Fever A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus Worsening asthma  Aspergilloma Certain chronic lung (pulmonary) conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis, can cause air spaces (cavities) to form in the lungs. When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas. Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause:  A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis) Wheezing Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss Fatigue  Invasive aspergillosis This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain, heart, kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated, this form of aspergillosis may be fatal. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause:  Fever and chills A cough that brings up blood (hemoptysis) Shortness of breath Chest or joint pain Headaches or eye symptoms Skin lesions  Other types of aspergillosis Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses. In your sinuses, the fungus can cause a stuffy nose sometimes accompanied by drainage that may contain blood. Fever, facial pain and headache may also occur.",75

"For most people, antibiotic-associated diarrhea causes mild signs and symptoms, such as:  Loose stools More-frequent bowel movements  Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is likely to begin about a week after you start taking an antibiotic. Sometimes, however, diarrhea and other symptoms don't appear until days or even weeks after you've finished antibiotic treatment. Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection C. difficile is a toxin-producing bacterium that can cause a more serious antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In addition to causing loose stools and more-frequent bowel movements, C. difficile infection can cause:  Severe diarrhea and dehydration Lower abdominal pain and cramping Low-grade fever Nausea Loss of appetite  When to see a doctor Call your doctor right away if you have serious signs and symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. These signs and symptoms are common to a number of conditions, so your doctor might recommend tests — such as stool or blood tests — to determine the cause.",58

"Symptoms may go unrecognized at first, or they may only occur when the heart is beating hard like during exercise. As the coronary arteries continue to narrow, less and less blood gets to the heart and symptoms can become more severe or frequent. Coronary artery disease signs and symptoms can include:  Chest pain (angina). You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest. Some people say it feels like someone is standing on their chest. The chest pain usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest. Activity or strong emotions can trigger angina. The pain usually goes away within minutes after the triggering event ends. In some people, especially women, the pain may be brief or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back. Shortness of breath. You may feel like you can't catch your breath. Fatigue. If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may feel unusually tired. Heart attack. A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing chest pain or pressure, shoulder or arm pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. Women may have less typical symptoms, such as neck or jaw pain, nausea and fatigue. Some heart attacks don't cause any noticeable signs or symptoms. ",249

"Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. This is especially true if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms. Ruptured aneurysm A sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm. This headache is often described by people as the worst headache they've ever experienced. In addition to a severe headache, symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include:  Nausea and vomiting Stiff neck Blurred or double vision Sensitivity to light Seizure A drooping eyelid Loss of consciousness Confusion  'Leaking' aneurysm In some cases, an aneurysm may leak a slight amount of blood. When this happens, a more severe rupture often follows. Leaks may happen days or weeks before a rupture. Leaking brain aneurysm symptoms may include:  A sudden, extremely severe headache that may last several days and up to two weeks.  Unruptured aneurysm An unruptured brain aneurysm may not have any symptoms, especially if it's small. However, a larger unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves. Symptoms of an unruptured brain aneurysm may include:  Pain above and behind one eye. A dilated pupil. A change in vision or double vision. Numbness of one side of the face. ",131

"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is difficult to diagnose. Often, it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms and signs of type 1 AIP are similar to those of pancreatic cancer. AIP Pancreatic cancer signs and symptoms can include:  Dark urine Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Pain in your upper abdomen or middle part of your back Nausea and vomiting Weakness or extreme tiredness Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness Weight loss for no known reason  The most common sign of type 1 AIP, present in about 80% of people, is painless jaundice, caused by blocked bile ducts. Type 2 AIP can present with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is frequently absent in autoimmune pancreatitis. AIP AIP Differences between type 1 and type 2 AIP are: AIP  In type 1 AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2 AIP affects only the pancreas, although the disease is associated with another autoimmune condition, inflammatory bowel disease. Type 1 AIP predominantly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life. Type 2 AIP affects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1 AIP. Type 1 AIP is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued. ",89

They may include fear, anxiety or a feeling that you've already lived this moment, known as deja vu.  Health care providers typically classify seizures as focal or generalized. Seizures are classified based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. If providers don't know how the seizures began, they may classify the seizures as unknown onset. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain. This type of seizure can occur with or without loss of consciousness:  Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. People having these types of seizures may seem awake but they stare into space and don't respond to their environment. They may perform repetitive movements such as hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. They may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred.  Focal seizures without impaired awareness. These seizures may alter emotions. They also may change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. But the seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. During these types of seizures, people may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are hard to describe. These seizures may result in trouble speaking and involuntary jerking of a body part such as an arm or a leg. They also may cause sudden sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights.   Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other disorders of the brain or nervous system. They include migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include:  Absence seizures. Absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children. Absence seizures typically cause a person to stare into space or make subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for 5 to 10 seconds. These seizures may happen up to hundreds of times a day. They may occur in clusters and can cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of the muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs. People who experience these seizures may lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. People having this type of seizure may suddenly fall down or drop their head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking. They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue. They may last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizures also may start as focal seizures that then spread to involve most or all of the brain. ",894

"Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment. MRI CT Pituitary tumor symptoms may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other parts of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall. Symptoms from tumor pressure Macroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other parts of the body nearby. That can cause symptoms such as:  Headache. Eye problems due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision. Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain.

Low amounts of hormones Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptoms may include:  Tiredness or weakness. Lack of energy. Sexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex. Changes in menstrual cycles. Nausea. Feeling cold. Losing or gaining weight without trying.  High amounts of hormones Functioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone. That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following types of functioning pituitary adenomas cause different symptoms depending on the hormones they make. Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. This causes a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. ACTH ACTH Cushing disease symptoms include:  Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back. Rounded face. Stretch marks. Thin skin that bruises easily. Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness. Thicker or more visible body hair. Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections. Areas of darkened skin. Acne. Changes in menstrual cycles. Sexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex.  Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause:  Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide spaces between teeth. Growth of hands and feet. Thicker skin. More sweating and body odor. Joint pain. A deeper voice.  Children and teens who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism. Pituitary tumors that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known as gonadotropins. Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas. It's uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptoms do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect women and men differently. LH FSH Symptoms in women may include:  Change in menstrual cycles. Fertility problems. Enlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.  Symptoms in men may include:  Enlarged testicles. Higher levels of testosterone.  Pituitary tumors that make prolactin These adenomas are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's levels of sex hormones — estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affects men and women differently. In women, too much prolactin might cause:  Irregular menstrual cycles. Lack of menstrual cycles. Milky discharge from the breasts. Breast tenderness. Problems with fertility. Less interest in sex.  In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include:  Problems with erections. Less interest in sex. Breast growth. Problems with fertility. Less body and facial hair.  Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include:  Weight loss. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. Frequent bowel movements. Sweating. Tremor. Sleep problems. ",758

"Signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individuals and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial features Facial appearance is one of the key clinical features that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These features may be more pronounced in infants and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct features become more subtle. Features may include the following:  Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial features may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age.  Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key signs and symptoms of the disorder. Some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include:  Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome.  Growth issues Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following:  Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone levels may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed. But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common.  Musculoskeletal issues Some common issues can include:  An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipples Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) Deformities of the spine  Learning disabilities Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individuals may have:  An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning  Eye conditions A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids. These may include:  Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) Cataracts  Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets. Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems:  May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet  Genital and kidney conditions Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys.  Testicles. Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boys and girls. Fertility. Most females develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problems are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome.  Skin conditions People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are:  Various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair  When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available.",687

Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone can be particularly difficult for people who stutter. However, most people who stutter can speak without stuttering when they talk to themselves and when they sing or speak in unison with someone else. When to see a doctor or speech-language pathologist It's common for children between the ages of 2 and 5 years to go through periods when they may stutter. For most children, this is part of learning to speak, and it gets better on its own. However, stuttering that persists may require treatment to improve speech fluency.  Call your doctor for a referral or contact a speech-language pathologist directly for an appointment if stuttering:  Lasts more than six months Occurs with other speech or language problems Becomes more frequent or continues as the child grows older Occurs with muscle tightening or visibly struggling to speak Affects the ability to effectively communicate at school, at work or in social interactions Causes anxiety or emotional problems, such as fear or avoidance of situations where speaking is required Begins as an adult ",949

"Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs. But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths. Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:  Skin changes. Skin changes are most common. These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head. Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. Behavior problems. Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males. Eye problems. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision. Dental changes. Teeth may have pits in the surface. Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue. ",1020

"Many people with Chiari malformation have no signs or symptoms and don't need treatment. Their condition is detected only when tests are performed for unrelated disorders. However, depending on the type and severity, Chiari malformation can cause a number of problems. The more common types of Chiari malformation are:  Type 1 Type 2  Although these types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3, signs and symptoms still can be life disrupting. Chiari malformation type 1 In Chiari malformation type 1, signs and symptoms usually appear during late childhood or adulthood. Headaches, often severe, are the classic symptom of Chiari malformation. They generally occur after sudden coughing, sneezing or straining. People with Chiari malformation type 1 can also experience:  Neck pain Unsteady gait (problems with balance) Poor hand coordination (fine motor skills) Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet Dizziness Difficulty swallowing, sometimes accompanied by gagging, choking and vomiting Speech problems, such as hoarseness  Less often, people with Chiari malformation may experience:  Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Weakness Slow heart rhythm Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) related to spinal cord impairment Breathing problems, such as central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep  Chiari malformation type 2 In Chiari malformation type 2, a greater amount of tissue extends into the spinal canal compared with that in Chiari malformation type 1. The signs and symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele that nearly always accompanies Chiari malformation type 2. In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don't close properly before birth. Signs and symptoms may include:  Changes in breathing pattern Swallowing problems, such as gagging Quick downward eye movements Weakness in the arms  Chiari malformation type 2 is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy. It may also be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy. Chiari malformation type 3 In the most severe type of the condition, Chiari malformation type 3, a portion of the lower back part of the brain (cerebellum) or the brainstem extends through an opening in the back of the skull. This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or with an ultrasound during pregnancy. This type of Chiari malformation has a higher mortality rate and may also cause neurological problems.",192

The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:  Tiredness. More sensitivity to cold. Constipation. Dry skin. Weight gain. Puffy face. Hoarse voice. Coarse hair and skin. Muscle weakness. Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. Thinning hair. Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. Depression. Memory problems.  Hypothyroidism in infants Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include:  Feeding problems. Poor growth. Poor weight gain. Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice. Constipation. Poor muscle tone. Dry skin. Hoarse crying. Enlarged tongue. A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.  When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems. Hypothyroidism in children and teens In general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. But they also may have:  Poor growth that leads to short stature. Delayed development of permanent teeth. Delayed puberty. Poor mental development. ",511

"The physical signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to starvation. Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms Physical signs and symptoms of anorexia may include:  Extreme weight loss or not making expected developmental weight gains Thin appearance Abnormal blood counts Fatigue Insomnia Dizziness or fainting Bluish discoloration of the fingers Hair that thins, breaks or falls out Soft, downy hair covering the body Absence of menstruation Constipation and abdominal pain Dry or yellowish skin Intolerance of cold Irregular heart rhythms Low blood pressure Dehydration Swelling of arms or legs Eroded teeth and calluses on the knuckles from induced vomiting  Some people who have anorexia binge and purge, similar to individuals who have bulimia. But people with anorexia generally struggle with an abnormally low body weight, while individuals with bulimia typically are normal to above normal weight.

In general, the affected portion of your knee might feel warm, tender and swollen when you put pressure on it. You might also feel pain when you move or even at rest. A sharp blow to the knee can cause symptoms to appear rapidly. But most cases of knee bursitis result from friction and irritation of the bursa that occurs in jobs that require a lot of kneeling on hard surfaces — so symptoms usually begin gradually and can worsen over time.

"A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:  Withdrawal from friends or usual activities Changes in behavior — such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or changes in school performance Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence Sleep problems and nightmares  An apparent lack of supervision Frequent absences from school Rebellious or defiant behavior Self-harm or attempts at suicide  Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused. Physical abuse signs and symptoms  Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones (fractures) or burns Injuries that don't match the given explanation Injuries that aren't compatible with the child's developmental ability  Sexual abuse signs and symptoms  Sexual behavior or knowledge that's inappropriate for the child's age Pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection Genital or anal pain, bleeding, or injury Statements by the child that he or she was sexually abused Inappropriate sexual behavior with other children  Emotional abuse signs and symptoms  Delayed or inappropriate emotional development Loss of self-confidence or self-esteem Social withdrawal or a loss of interest or enthusiasm Depression Avoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus Appears to desperately seek affection A decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school Loss of previously acquired developmental skills  Neglect signs and symptoms  Poor growth Excessive weight with medical complications that are not being adequately addressed Poor personal cleanliness Lack of clothing or supplies to meet physical needs Hoarding or stealing food Poor record of school attendance Lack of appropriate attention for medical, dental or psychological problems or lack of necessary follow-up care  Parental behavior Sometimes a parent's demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse. Warning signs include a parent who:  Shows little concern for the child Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child Blames the child for the problems Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as ""worthless"" or ""evil"" Expects the child to provide attention and care to the parent and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child Uses harsh physical discipline Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance Severely limits the child's contact with others Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all Repeatedly brings the child for medical evaluations or requests medical tests, such as X-rays and lab tests, for concerns not seen during the health care provider's examination  Physical punishment Child health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, but some people still use physical punishment, such as spanking, to discipline their children. While parents and caregivers often use physical punishment with the intention of helping their children or making their behavior better, research shows that spanking is linked with worse, not better, behavior. It's also linked to mental health problems, difficult relationships with parents, lower self-esteem and lower academic performance. Any physical punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behaviors that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse.",196

"Although your body can harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctors make a distinction between:  Latent TB. You have a TB infection, but the bacteria in your body are inactive and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. Latent TB can turn into active TB, so treatment is important. Active TB. Also called TB disease, this condition makes you sick and, in most cases, can spread to others. It can occur weeks or years after infection with the TB bacteria.  Signs and symptoms of active TB include: TB  Coughing for three or more weeks Coughing up blood or mucus Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweats Chills Loss of appetite  Tuberculosis can also affect other parts of your body, including the kidneys, spine or brain. When TB occurs outside your lungs, signs and symptoms vary according to the organs involved. For example, tuberculosis of the spine might cause back pain, and tuberculosis in your kidneys might cause blood in your urine.",1019

"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include:  A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical  Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include:  Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.  Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head.

"Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months. PKU PKU Signs and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include: PKU  A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures Skin rashes, such as eczema Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Unusually small head size (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral, emotional and social problems Mental health disorders  Severity varies The severity of PKU depends on the type. PKU  Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage.  Regardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. PKU Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby. PKU PKU PKU Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. PKU PKU Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU. But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have:  PKU  Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart  In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior.",752

Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin. Signs and symptoms of frostbite include:  At first, cold skin and a prickling feeling Numbness Skin that looks red, white, bluish-white, grayish-yellow, purplish, brown or ashen, depending on the severity of the condition and usual skin color Hard or waxy-looking skin Clumsiness due to joint and muscle stiffness Blistering after rewarming, in severe cases  Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown or Black skin. Frostbite occurs in several stages:  Frostnip. Frostnip is a mild form of frostbite. Continued cold exposure leads to numbness in the affected area. As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent skin damage. Superficial frostbite. Superficial frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm — a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may appear mottled. And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling. A fluid-filled blister may appear 12 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin. Deep (severe) frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin as well as the tissues that lie below. The skin turns white or blue-gray and you lose all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the area. Joints or muscles may stop working. Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. The tissue turns black and hard as it dies. ",390

It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy. A rash Other stage 1 symptoms include:  Fever. Headache. Extreme tiredness. Joint stiffness. Muscle aches and pains. Swollen lymph nodes.  Stage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease. Stage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:  Many rashes on other parts of the body. Neck pain or stiffness. Muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face. Immune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats. Pain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs. Pain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet. Painful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid. Immune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.  Stage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease. In the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite. The type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints. This skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.",592

"Hyperglycemia usually doesn't cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high — above 180 to 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 10 to 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Symptoms of hyperglycemia develop slowly over several days or weeks. The longer blood sugar levels stay high, the more serious symptoms may become. But some people who've had type 2 diabetes for a long time may not show any symptoms despite high blood sugar levels. Early signs and symptoms Recognizing early symptoms of hyperglycemia can help identify and treat it right away. Watch for:  Frequent urination Increased thirst Blurred vision Feeling weak or unusually tired   Later signs and symptoms If hyperglycemia isn't treated, it can cause toxic acids, called ketones, to build up in the blood and urine. This condition is called ketoacidosis. Symptoms include:  Fruity-smelling breath Dry mouth Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Confusion Loss of consciousness ",496

"There are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms. Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include:  Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.  Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. NF1 NF2 Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include:  Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Poor balance Headaches  Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. NF2 NF2 Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include:  Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs Pain Balance difficulties Facial drop Vision problems or cataracts  Seizures Headache  Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves — but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2. NF2 Symptoms of schwannomatosis include:  Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body Loss of muscle ",679

"Gender dysphoria might cause adolescents and adults to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that lasts for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following:   A difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such as breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristics of another gender. A strong desire to be or to be treated as another gender. A strong belief of having the typical feelings and reactions of another gender.  Gender dysphoria may also cause significant distress that affects how you function in social situations, at work or school, and in other areas of life. Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life. Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspects of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased. If gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulties are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problems can occur. People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health services and mental health services can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers. Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.

Paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs, is called quadriplegia. Your ability to control your limbs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors: where the injury occurred on your spinal cord and the severity of injury. The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to as the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called ""the completeness"" and is classified as either of the following:  Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.  Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:  Tetraplegia. Also known as quadriplegia, this means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia. This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs.  Your health care team will perform a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. Spinal cord injuries can cause one or more of the following signs and symptoms:  Loss of movement Loss of or altered sensation, including the ability to feel heat, cold and touch Loss of bowel or bladder control Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in your spinal cord Difficulty breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from your lungs  Emergency signs and symptoms Emergency signs and symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include:  Extreme back pain or pressure in your neck, head or back Weakness, incoordination or paralysis in any part of your body Numbness, tingling or loss of sensation in your hands, fingers, feet or toes Loss of bladder or bowel control Difficulty with balance and walking Impaired breathing after injury An oddly positioned or twisted neck or back ",930
"Breast cysts may be found in one or both breasts. Signs and symptoms of a breast cyst include:  A smooth, easily movable round or oval lump that may have smooth edges — which typically, though not always, indicates it's benign Nipple discharge that may be clear, yellow, straw colored or dark brown Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the breast lump An increase in breast lump size and breast tenderness just before your period A decrease in breast lump size and resolution of other symptoms after your period  Having breast cysts doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer. But having cysts may make it harder to find new breast lumps or other changes that might need evaluation by your doctor. Your breasts may feel lumpy and painful when you're menstruating, so it's important to be familiar with how your breasts feel throughout your menstrual cycle so that you'll know if something changes.",136

Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.  ",538

"Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning. Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. OCD Obsessions often have themes to them, such as:  Fear of contamination or dirt Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects  Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include:  Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of driving your car into a crowd of people Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public Unpleasant sexual images Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands  Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. OCD You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as:  Washing and cleaning Checking Counting Orderliness Following a strict routine Demanding reassurance  Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include:  Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off Counting in certain patterns Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase Arranging your canned goods to face the same way  Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling.",690

"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. But memory gets worse and other symptoms develop as the disease progresses.  At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Memory Everyone has memory lapses at times, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and gets worse. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's disease may:  Repeat statements and questions over and over. Forget conversations, appointments or events. Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense. Get lost in places they used to know well. Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects. Have trouble finding the right words for objects, expressing thoughts or taking part in conversations.  Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially difficult. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's disease causes a decline in the ability to make sensible decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. It may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems. For example, the person may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or decisions when driving. Planning and performing familiar tasks Routine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle. This may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's disease forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following:  Depression. Loss of interest in activities. Social withdrawal. Mood swings. Distrust in others. Anger or aggression. Changes in sleeping habits. Wandering. Loss of inhibitions. Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen.  Preserved skills Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to hold on to some skills even as symptoms get worse. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they're controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease.",37

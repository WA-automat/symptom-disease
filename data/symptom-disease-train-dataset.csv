"Signs and symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency are similar to those of menopause or estrogen deficiency. They include:  Irregular or skipped periods, which might be present for years or develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills Difficulty getting pregnant Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness Dry eyes Irritability or difficulty concentrating Decreased sexual desire  When to see a health care provider If you've missed your period for three months or more, see your health care provider to determine the cause. You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your provider to find out what's causing the change. Low estrogen levels can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of heart disease.",798

"Posterior cortical atrophy symptoms vary among people. Symptoms also can vary over time. They tend to gradually get worse. Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition. Risk factors Further study is needed to determine whether the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease may play a role in posterior cortical atrophy.

"An unusual sensation (aura) may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras, and not everyone who has auras remembers them. The aura is actually the first part of a focal seizure before consciousness is impaired. Examples of auras include:  A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before A sudden or strange odor or taste A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster  Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:  Loss of awareness of surroundings Staring Lip smacking Repeated swallowing or chewing Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions  After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:  A period of confusion and difficulty speaking Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure Unawareness of having had a seizure Extreme sleepiness  In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.",971

"A hemangioma may be present at birth, but more often appears during the first several months of life. It starts as a flat red mark anywhere on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. Usually a child has only one mark. Some children may have more than one, particularly if they're part of a multiple birth. During your child's first year, the red mark grows rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase and, eventually, it begins to slowly disappear. Many hemangiomas disappear by age 5, and most are gone by age 10. The skin may be slightly discolored or raised after the hemangioma goes away.",457

"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) affects many parts of your body. Symptoms usually start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms you have when you're diagnosed. MSA Parkinsonian type This is the most common type of MSA. The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease, such as: MSA  Stiff muscles Difficulty bending your arms and legs Slow movement (bradykinesia) Tremors can occur at rest or when moving your arms or legs Soft voice Problems with posture and balance  Cerebellar type The main signs and symptoms are problems with muscle coordination (ataxia), but others may include:  Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance Slurred, slow or low-volume speech (dysarthria) Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing Changes in speech, such as slurred speech   General signs and symptoms In addition, the primary sign of multiple system atrophy is autonomic failure, which may cause problems with body functions you can't control. This may include: Postural (orthostatic) hypotension Postural hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even faint, when you stand up from sitting or lying down. Not everyone with MSA has postural hypotension. MSA You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down (supine hypertension). Urinary and bowel dysfunction  Constipation Loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence)  Changes in sweat production  Producing less sweat Heat intolerance due to reduced sweating Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet  Sleep disorders  Agitated sleep due to ""acting out"" dreams Abnormal breathing at night or a harsh breathing sound (stridor)  Sexual dysfunction  Inability to achieve or maintain an erection (impotence) Loss of libido  Cardiovascular problems  Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood  Psychiatric problems  Difficulty controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying inappropriately ",654

"A popliteal artery aneurysm may not cause any noticeable symptoms. The first symptom may be pain the lower leg that occurs with walking (claudication). Other signs and symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include:   Knee pain Lower leg pain Swelling behind the knee Pulsing sensation behind the knee  Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including:  Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) High blood pressure Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repetitive use of the knee joint Weakening of the artery wall  Risk factors Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. They are more common in men than in women. Popiteal artery aneurysms often occur in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery (aorta). Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA. AAA Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include:  Increasing age High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Narrowing of a heart valve (stenotic disease) Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body  Complications Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots (thrombosis) and, rarely, rupture of the aneurysm. Thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm can cause a severe lack of blood flow (ischemia) in the lower leg, which may result in loss of the limb. Sudden leg ischemia can cause the following signs and symptoms:  A change in skin color in the affected area No pulse behind the knee Skin in the affected area feels cold Numbness in the leg Inability to move the foot  The risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low. Prevention Smoking and high blood pressure (hypertension) increase the risk of blood vessel (vascular) problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle — such as not smoking, eating a nutritious diet and getting regular exercise — can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage.

"The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life. Physical defects Physical defects may include:  Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers Slow physical growth before and after birth Vision difficulties or hearing problems Small head circumference and brain size Heart defects and problems with kidneys and bones  Brain and central nervous system problemsProblems with the brain and central nervous system may include:  Poor coordination or balance Intellectual disability, learning disorders and delayed development Poor memory Trouble with attention and with processing information Difficulty with reasoning and problem-solving Difficulty identifying consequences of choices Poor judgment skills Jitteriness or hyperactivity Rapidly changing moods  Social and behavioral issuesProblems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include:  Difficulty in school Trouble getting along with others Poor social skills Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another Problems with behavior and impulse control Poor concept of time Problems staying on task Difficulty planning or working toward a goal  When to see a doctorIf you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help. Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant.

This is the most common form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, starting around 2 years of age or younger. Progressive loss of speech and muscle function occurs rapidly. Children with this form often do not survive beyond childhood. Juvenile form. This is the second most common form and starts in children between 3 and 16 years of age. Early signs are behavior and cognitive problems and increasing difficulty in school. Loss of the ability to walk may occur. Although the juvenile form doesn't progress as fast as the late infantile form, survival is generally less than 20 years after symptoms begin. Adult form. This form is less common and typically starts after age 16. Signs progress slowly and may begin with behavior and psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol misuse, and issues with school and work. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may occur. The course of this form varies, with periods of stable symptoms and periods of rapid decline in functioning.

"There are different types of Gaucher disease, and signs and symptoms of disease vary widely, even within the same type. Type 1 is by far the most common. Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity. Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms. Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems:  Abdominal complaints. Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended. Skeletal abnormalities. Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds.  More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.",406

"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the signs and symptoms of CF show up. CF Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. CF Respiratory signs and symptoms The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as:  A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) Wheezing Exercise intolerance Repeated lung infections Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose Recurrent sinusitis  Digestive signs and symptoms The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often:  Foul-smelling, greasy stools Poor weight gain and growth Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) Chronic or severe constipation, which may include frequent straining while trying to pass stool, eventually causing part of the rectum to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse) ",264

"Some people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. ADHD ADHD Many adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger. ADHD ADHD Adult ADHD symptoms may include: ADHD  Impulsiveness Disorganization and problems prioritizing Poor time management skills Problems focusing on a task Trouble multitasking Excessive activity or restlessness Poor planning Low frustration tolerance Frequent mood swings Problems following through and completing tasks Hot temper Trouble coping with stress  What's typical behavior and what's ADHD? Almost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood. ADHD ADHD ADHD Diagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety.",22

As stones move into your ureters — the thin tubes that allow urine to pass from your kidneys to your bladder — signs and symptoms can result. Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include severe pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and blood in your urine. A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder. If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful. At that point, you may experience these symptoms:  Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity Pain or burning sensation while urinating  Other signs and symptoms may include:  Pink, red or brown urine Cloudy or foul-smelling urine A persistent need to urinate, urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills if an infection is present  Pain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract.",556

Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are usually painful and can leave scars. Eyes. Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go. Joints. Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own. Blood vessels. Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. Digestive system. A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding. Brain.

"An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:  Sudden stop in motion without falling Lip smacking Eyelid flutters Chewing motions Finger rubbing Small movements of both hands  Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming. When to see a doctor Contact your doctor:    The first time you notice a seizure If this is a new type of seizure If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication  Contact 911 or emergency services in your area:  If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours — activities such as eating or moving without awareness — or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus After any seizure lasting more than five minutes ",750

Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops. Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with:  Female genitals Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals) Underdeveloped male genitals  Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper:  Development of muscle mass Voice deepening Growth of body and facial hair Growth of the penis and testicles  And it can cause:  Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)  Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include:  Decreased sex drive Decreased energy Depression  Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop:  Erectile dysfunction Infertility Decrease in hair growth on the face and body Decrease in muscle mass Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)  Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include:  Difficulty concentrating Hot flashes  When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism. Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.",598

"Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages. Prodrome One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:  Constipation Mood changes, from depression to euphoria Food cravings Neck stiffness Increased urination Fluid retention Frequent yawning  Aura For some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes. Examples of migraine auras include:  Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light Vision loss Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body Difficulty speaking  Attack A migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. How often migraines occur varies from person to person. Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month. During a migraine, you might have:  Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides Pain that throbs or pulses Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch Nausea and vomiting  Post-drome After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day.

(21 cm) Special care If you give birth to a preterm baby, your baby will likely need to stay in a special nursery unit at the hospital. Some infants need to spend time in a unit that cares for them and closely tracks their health day and night. This is called a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A step down from the NICU is an intermediate care nursery, which provides less intensive care. Special nursery units are staffed with health care providers and a team that's trained to help preterm babies. NICU Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery. Your health care team can help you understand what's needed and what your baby's care plan will be. Feel free to ask them questions.",796

Some conditions require prompt treatment to avoid permanent damage to a testicle. See your doctor if you detect a lump in your scrotum, even if it's not painful or tender, or if you experience other symptoms of a scrotal mass. Some scrotal masses are more common in children. See your doctor if your child experiences symptoms of a scrotal mass, if you have any concerns about the development of the genitals or if a testicle is “missing” — an undescended or retractile testicle, which might increase the risk of some scrotal masses later in life.",889

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include:  Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasms Swelling Muscle weakness  When to see the doctor Mild strains can be treated at home. See a doctor if your symptoms worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable, or you experience numbness or tingling. Causes Acute strains can be caused by one event, such as using poor body mechanics to lift something heavy. Chronic muscle strains can result from repetitive injuries when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over. Risk factors Participating in contact sports — such as soccer, football, hockey, boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains. Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports. Examples include:  Legs and ankles. Sports that feature quick starts and jumping, such as hurdling and basketball, can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle. Hands. Gripping sports, such as gymnastics or golf, can increase your risk of muscle strains in your hands. Elbows. Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports.  Prevention Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport, fitness or work activity, as part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains. Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries.

It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:  Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. ",435

"Many people with von Willebrand disease don't know it because the signs are mild or absent. The most common sign of the condition is abnormal bleeding. There are three main types of the disease. The amount of bleeding varies from one person to another, depending on the type and severity of the disease. If you have von Willebrand disease, you might have:  Excessive bleeding from an injury or after surgery or dental work Frequent nosebleeds that don't stop within 10 minutes Heavy or long menstrual bleeding Heavy bleeding during labor and delivery Blood in your urine or stool Easy bruising or lumpy bruises  Menstrual signs and symptoms might include:  Blood clots greater than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter in your menstrual flow The need to change your menstrual pad or tampon more than once an hour The need to use double sanitary protection for menstrual flow Symptoms of anemia, including tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath ",1062

The chest pain or discomfort may feel like:  Burning Fullness Pressure Squeezing  Pain may also be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back.  Other symptoms of angina include:  Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Shortness of breath Sweating  The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. New or different symptoms may signal a more dangerous form of angina (unstable angina) or a heart attack. Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be evaluated immediately by a health care provider who can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina. Angina in women Symptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain is a common symptom in women with angina, but it may not be the only symptom or the most prevalent symptom for women. Women may also have symptoms such as:  Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back Nausea Shortness of breath Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure Stomach (abdominal) pain ",52

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture. Mild fractures might be mistaken for sprains or bruises. More-severe greenstick fractures may cause an obvious deformity, accompanied by significant pain and swelling. When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child has persistent pain in an injured limb. Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain, deformity and swelling. Causes Childhood fractures most commonly occur with a fall. Arm fractures are more common than leg fractures, since the common reaction is to throw out your arms to catch yourself when you fall. Risk factors The risk of greenstick fractures is higher in young children because their bones are softer and more flexible than adult bones. In a greenstick fracture, the bone bends and cracks instead of breaking into separate pieces. Most greenstick fractures occur in children under age 10.

"Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include:  Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss  Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:  Inflammation — follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.  All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood.",1003

"Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include:  Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements  Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include:  Cerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia). This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs.  Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction in males. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer.   Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma).  Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a ""bag of worms,"" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. ",719

"Early in chronic kidney disease, you might have no signs or symptoms. As chronic kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal disease, signs and symptoms might include:  Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue and weakness Changes in how much you urinate Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs Swelling of feet and ankles High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Headaches Difficulty sleeping Decreased mental sharpness Muscle twitches and cramps Persistent itching Metallic taste  Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys can make up for lost function, signs and symptoms might not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. When to seek care Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your care provider is likely to monitor your kidney function with urine and blood tests and your blood pressure during regular office visits. Ask your provider whether these tests are necessary for you.",339
"Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including:  Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming  Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus. If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus).",990

"Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can:  Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them. Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office.  At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can:  Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure. ",667

"Some men with delayed ejaculation need 30 minutes or more of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. Other men might not be able to ejaculate at all (anejaculation). But, there's no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Instead, you are probably experiencing delayed ejaculation if the delay is causing distress or frustration, or if you have to stop sexual activity due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection or a request from your partner. Often, men might have difficulty reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some men can ejaculate only when masturbating. Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms:  Lifelong vs. acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning. Generalized vs. situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation. Situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances.  These categories help in diagnosing an underlying cause and determining what might be the most effective treatment.",272

"Aphasia is a symptom of some other condition, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. A person with aphasia may:  Speak in short or incomplete sentences Speak in sentences that don't make sense Substitute one word for another or one sound for another Speak unrecognizable words Have difficulty finding words Not understand other people's conversation Not understand what they read Write sentences that don't make sense  Patterns of aphasia People with aphasia may have different strengths and weaknesses in their speech patterns. Sometimes these patterns are labeled as different types of aphasia, including:  Broca's aphasia  Wernicke aphasia Transcortical aphasia Conduction aphasia Mixed aphasia Global aphasia  These patterns describe how well the person can understand what others say. They also describe how easy it is for the person to speak or to correctly repeat what someone else says. Aphasia may develop slowly over time. When that happens, the aphasia may be labeled with one of these names:  Logopenic aphasia Semantic aphasia Agrammatism  Many people with aphasia have patterns of speech difficulty that don't match these types. It may help to consider that each person with aphasia has unique symptoms, strengths and weaknesses rather than trying to label a particular type of aphasia.",66

"A brain arteriovenous malformation may not cause any signs or symptoms until the AVM ruptures, resulting in hemorrhage. In about half of all brain AVMs, hemorrhage is the first sign. AVM AVM But some people with brain AVM may experience signs and symptoms other than bleeding, such as: AVM  Seizures Headache or pain in one area of the head Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body  Some people may experience more-serious neurological signs and symptoms, depending on the location of the AVM, including: AVM  Severe headache Weakness, numbness or paralysis Vision loss Difficulty speaking Confusion or inability to understand others Severe unsteadiness  Signs and symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually emerge between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. AVM AVM By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms. AVM Research hasn't found that pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhage for people with a brain AVM. However, more research needs to be done. AVM One severe type of brain AVM involves the vein of Galen. It causes signs and symptoms that emerge soon or immediately after birth. The major blood vessel involved in this type of brain AVM can cause fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. It can also cause swollen veins that are visible on the scalp, seizures, failure to thrive and congestive heart failure.",132
"If your child has clubfoot, here's what it might look like:  The top of the foot is usually twisted downward and inward, increasing the arch and turning the heel inward.

"Babies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child. The main signs and symptoms include:  Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body. Loss of movement and coordination abilities. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Unusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.  Other signs and symptoms can include:  Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Intellectual disabilities. Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.  Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:  Stage 1: Early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age. Stage 1 can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage 2: Rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage 3: Plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with less crying and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage 4: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often. ",855

"Signs and symptoms of calciphylaxis include:  Large purple net-like patterns on skin Deep, very painful lumps that ulcerate creating open sores with black-brown crust that fails to heal — typically in skin areas with high fat content, such as the stomach and thigh, although they can occur anywhere Infections from wounds that don't heal  Causes The exact cause of calciphylaxis is unknown, but recent studies have revealed that most people with the condition have abnormalities in blood-clotting factors. Blood-clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding. These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would. In addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium. This causes calcium to be deposited in the smallest parts of the arteries (arterioles), which eventually leads to the formation of blood clots in the arterioles. Blood clots can cause fat tissues and skin to be deprived of oxygen and nourishment.",164

"Signs and symptoms of CAH vary, depending on which gene is affected and the level of enzyme deficiency. The imbalance of hormones the body needs to function may mean too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, excess androgens or a combination of these imbalances. CAH Classic CAH Signs and symptoms of classic CAH may include: CAH  Insufficient cortisol. Classic CAH causes the body to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. This can cause problems maintaining normal blood pressure, blood sugar and energy levels, and cause problems during physical stress such as illness. Adrenal crisis. People with classic CAH can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life-threatening.  Atypical genitalia. Female infants may have atypical genitalia appearance, such as an enlarged clitoris that may resemble a penis, and a partially closed labia resembling a scrotum. The urinary opening (urethra) and the vagina may be only one opening instead of two separate openings. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries usually develop typically. Male infants usually have typical-appearing genitals.   Excess androgen. An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can result in short height and early puberty for both males and females. Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. Severe acne also may occur. Excess androgen hormones in females may result in facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice.  Altered growth. Rapid growth may occur during childhood with an advanced bone age. Final height may be shorter than average. Fertility issues. These can include irregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and having infertility problems in females. Fertility issues can sometimes occur in males.  Nonclassic CAH Often there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. Some people with nonclassic CAH never have symptoms. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone that's deficient. CAH CAH Females who have nonclassic CAH may have typical-appearing genitals at birth. Later in life, they may experience: CAH  Irregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and problems getting pregnant Masculine characteristics such as facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice  In both females and males, signs of nonclassic CAH may also include: CAH  Early appearance of pubic hair and other signs of early puberty Severe acne Rapid growth during childhood with an advanced bone age and shorter than expected final height ",240

"Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have many speech symptoms or characteristics that vary depending on their age and the severity of their speech problems. CAS can be associated with: CAS  Delayed onset of first words A limited number of spoken words The ability to form only a few consonant or vowel sounds  These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years, and may indicate suspected CAS. CAS As children produce more speech, usually between ages 2 and 4, characteristics that likely indicate CAS include: CAS  Vowel and consonant distortions Separation of syllables in or between words Voicing errors, such as ""pie"" sounding like ""bye""  Many children with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound, and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. CAS Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. CAS Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. CAS CAS CAS CAS Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: CAS CAS  Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sounds Vowel distortions, such as attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing ""banana"" as ""BUH-nan-uh"" instead of ""buh-NAN-uh"" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying ""BUH-NAN-UH"" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple words Inconsistent voicing errors, such as saying ""down"" instead of ""town""  Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and aren't helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: CAS CAS  Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months old Speaking first words late (after ages 12 to 18 months old) Using a limited number of consonants and vowels Frequently leaving out (omitting) sounds Using speech that is difficult to understand speech  Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. CAS A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. CAS Articulation or phonological speech errors may include:  Substituting sounds, such as saying ""fum"" instead of ""thumb,"" ""wabbit"" instead of ""rabbit"" or ""tup"" instead of ""cup"" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such as saying ""duh"" instead of ""duck"" or ""uh"" instead of ""up"" Stopping the airstream, such as saying ""tun"" instead of ""sun"" or ""doo"" instead of ""zoo"" Simplifying sound combinations, such as saying ""ting"" instead of ""string"" or ""fog"" instead of ""frog""  Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.",197

Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms. Abortive polio About 5% of people with the poliovirus get a mild version of the disease called abortive poliomyelitis. This leads to flu-like symptoms that last 2 to 3 days. These include:  Fever Headache Muscle aches Sore throat Stomachache Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting  Nonparalytic polio A more severe form of the disease, called nonparalytic polio, affects about 1% of those infected. While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn't cause paralysis. Besides having more-severe flu-like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include:  Neck pain or stiffness Aches or stiffness in the arms or legs Severe headache  A second phase of symptoms may follow, or a person may seem to be getting better for a few days before a second phase starts. These symptoms include:  Stiffness of the spine and neck Decreased reflexes Muscle weakness  Paralytic polio This most serious form of the disease is rare. The disease begins much like nonparalytic polio. But it progresses to more-severe signs and symptoms, including:  Intense pain Extreme sensitivity to touch Tingling or pricking sensations Muscles spasms or twitching Muscles weakness progressing to a limp paralysis  Any combination of limbs may experience paralysis. But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm. Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include:  Paralysis of muscles involved in breathing Difficulty swallowing  Post-polio syndrome Post-polio syndrome is the appearance of new signs or symptoms or the progression of problems. This usually happens decades after having polio. Common signs and symptoms include:  Progressive muscle or joint weakness and pain Fatigue Muscle wasting Breathing or swallowing problems Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea Lowered tolerance of cold temperatures ",770

Specific symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include:  Knee. Bone spurs in your knee can make it painful to extend and bend your leg. Spine. On your vertebrae, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains your spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots and can cause weakness or numbness in your arms or legs. Hip. Bone spurs can make it painful to move your hip, although you might feel the pain in your knee. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in your hip joint. ",126

During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:  Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain Anxiety, agitation or restlessness Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches  For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. Depression symptoms in children and teens Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.  In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.  Depression symptoms in older adults Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:  Memory difficulties or personality changes Physical aches or pain Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men ",278

"Signs and symptoms of geographic tongue may include:  Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches (lesions) on the top or side of your tongue Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of lesions Discomfort, pain or burning sensation in some cases, most often related to eating spicy or acidic foods  Many people with geographic tongue have no symptoms. Geographic tongue can continue for days, months or years. The problem often resolves on its own but may appear again at a later time. When to see a doctor Geographic tongue is a minor — although sometimes uncomfortable — condition. However, lesions on the tongue may indicate other more-serious conditions of the tongue or diseases affecting the body in general. If you have lesions on the tongue that don't resolve within 10 days, see your doctor or dentist.",411

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking:  Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality  Behavior:  Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use  Emotions:  Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others  Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include:  Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.  Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be:  Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations  Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions.  As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a ""break from reality"" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication.",200

"The four main characteristics of Henoch-Schonlein purpura include:  Rash (purpura). Reddish-purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet. The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline. Swollen, sore joints (arthritis). People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints — mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage. Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears. Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done. Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease. ",463

Heart-related chest pain Chest pain is often associated with heart disease. But many people with heart disease say they have a mild discomfort that they wouldn't really call pain. Chest discomfort due to a heart attack or another heart problem may feel like:  Pressure, fullness, burning or tightness in the chest. Crushing or searing pain that spreads to the back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms. Pain that lasts more than a few minutes, gets worse with activity, goes away and comes back, or varies in intensity. Shortness of breath. Cold sweats. Dizziness, lightheadedness or weakness. Racing heartbeats. Nausea or vomiting.  Other types of chest pain It can be difficult to tell if chest pain is related to the heart or caused by something else.

"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. Skin-related signs and symptoms Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin. The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness. Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. Digestive problems Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:  Heartburn Difficulty swallowing Bloating Diarrhea Constipation Fecal incontinence  Heart and lung problems When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people.",885

"Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. The dreamer of a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details, but a person who has a sleep terror episode remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall a dream fragment they had during the sleep terrors. Sleep terrors generally occur in the first third to first half of the night, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking. During a sleep terror episode, a person may:  Begin with a frightening scream or shout Sit up in bed and appear frightened Stare wide-eyed Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and dilated pupils Kick and thrash Be hard to awaken, and be confused if awakened Be inconsolable Have no or little memory of the event the next morning Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or restrained  When to see a doctor Occasional sleep terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has sleep terrors, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. However, consult your doctor if sleep terrors:  Become more frequent Routinely disrupt the sleep of the person with sleep terrors or other family members Lead to safety concerns or injury Result in daytime symptoms of excessive sleepiness or problems functioning Continue beyond the teen years or start in adulthood ",913

"The main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness. Specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups, depending on the type of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne type muscular dystrophy This is the most common form. Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys. Signs and symptoms, which typically appear in early childhood, might include:  Frequent falls Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting position Trouble running and jumping Waddling gait Walking on the toes Large calf muscles Muscle pain and stiffness Learning disabilities Delayed growth  Becker muscular dystrophy Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later. Other types of muscular dystrophy Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include:  Myotonic. This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks. Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD). Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but can begin in childhood or as late as age 50. Congenital. This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2. Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment. Limb-girdle. Hip and shoulder muscles are usually affected first. People with this type of muscular dystrophy might have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and so might trip frequently.

"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision. Skin The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:  Freckles. Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). Sunburn and no ability to tan.  For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:  Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better. Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision. Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness. ",29

"Most people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms. They often don't know they're infected. Some people have flu-like symptoms, including:  Fever. Swollen lymph nodes that may last for weeks. Headache. Muscle aches. Skin rash.  Symptoms of eye disease The toxoplasma parasites may infect tissues of the inner eye. This can occur in people with healthy immune systems. But the disease is more serious in people with weakened immunity. An infection in the eye is called ocular toxoplasmosis. Symptoms may include:  Eye pain. Poor vision. Floaters, which are specks that seem to swim in your vision.  Untreated eye disease can cause blindness. Effect on people with weakened immune systems People with weakened immune systems are likely to have more-serious disease from toxoplasmosis. A toxoplasmosis infection from earlier in life may become active again. People at risk include those living with HIV/AIDS, people receiving cancer treatment and people with a transplanted organ. In addition to serious eye disease, toxoplasmosis can cause severe lung or brain disease for a person with weakened immunity. Rarely, the infection can show up in other tissues throughout the body. Lung infection may cause:  Breathing problems. Fever. Cough.  Toxoplasmosis may cause inflammation of the brain, also called encephalitis. Symptoms may include:  Confusion. Poor coordination. Muscle weakness. Seizures. Changes in alertness.  Effect on fetus or infant Toxoplasmosis can pass from the mother to the fetus during a pregnancy. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. Infection during the first trimester often causes more-severe disease. It also may result in miscarriage. For some babies with toxoplasmosis, serious disease may be present at birth or appear early in infancy. Medical problems may include:  Too much fluid in or around the brain, also called hydrocephalus. Severe eye infection. Irregularities in brain tissues. An enlarged liver or spleen.  Symptoms of severe disease vary. They may include:  Problems with mental or motor skills. Blindness or other vision problems. Hearing problems. Seizures. Heart disorders. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, also called jaundice. Rash.  Most babies with toxoplasmosis do not show symptoms. But problems may show up later in childhood or teenage years. These include:  Return of eye infections. Problems with motor skill development. Problems with thinking and learning. Hearing loss. Slowed growth. Early puberty. ",1002

"There are three forms of Tay-Sachs disease: infantile, juvenile and late onset/adult. Infantile form In the most common and severe form, called infantile form, an infant typically begins showing signs and symptoms by about 3 to 6 months of age. Survival is usually only a few years. Signs and symptoms can include:  Exaggerated startle response when the baby hears loud noises ""Cherry-red"" spots in the eyes Loss of motor skills, including turning over, crawling and sitting up Muscle weakness, progressing to paralysis Movement problems Seizures Vision loss and blindness Hearing loss and deafness Problems swallowing Loss of mental functions and a lack of response to surroundings Growth in head size (progressive macrocephaly)  Juvenile form The juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease is less common. Signs and symptoms vary in severity and begin in childhood. Survival is typically into the teen years. Signs and symptoms can include:  Behavior problems Gradual loss of skills and movement control Frequent respiratory infections Slow loss of vision and speech Decline in mental function and responsiveness Seizures  Last onset/adult form This is a rare and less severe form with signs and symptoms beginning in late childhood to adulthood. Severity of symptoms varies greatly, and this form does not always impact life expectancy. Signs and symptoms progress slowly and can include:  Muscle weakness Clumsiness and loss of coordination Tremors and muscle spasms Loss of the ability to walk Problems speaking and swallowing Psychiatric disorders Sometimes loss of mental function ",969

"Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and progresses slowly. Some people with mitral valve regurgitation might not have symptoms for many years. But sometimes, mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly. This condition, called acute mitral valve regurgitation, causes sudden signs and symptoms. Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation. Other signs and symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include:  Sound of blood flow across the valve (heart murmur) Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially when lying down Sensation of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat (palpitations) Swollen feet or ankles (edema) ",637

"A fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump that often causes no pain. It is:  Round with distinct, smooth borders Easily moved Firm or rubbery  A fibroadenoma often grows slowly. The average size is about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). A fibroadenoma can get bigger over time. It may be tender or cause soreness a few days before your period. A large fibroadenoma may hurt when you touch it. But most often, this type of breast lump causes no pain. You can have a single fibroadenoma or more than one fibroadenoma. They can occur in one or both breasts. Some fibroadenomas shrink over time. Most fibroadenomas in adolescents shrink over many months to a few years. They then disappear. Fibroadenomas may also change shape over time. Fibroadenomas may get bigger during pregnancy. They might shrink after menopause.",377

"Signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include:  Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small.  Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include:  Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement — for example, sitting up or walking — later than other children do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders.

"Schizotypal personality disorder typically includes five or more of these signs and symptoms:  Being a loner and lacking close friends outside of the immediate family Flat emotions or limited or inappropriate emotional responses Persistent and excessive social anxiety Incorrect interpretation of events, such as a feeling that something that is actually harmless or inoffensive has a direct personal meaning Peculiar, eccentric or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms Suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others Belief in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions Unusual perceptions, such as sensing an absent person's presence or having illusions Dressing in peculiar ways, such as appearing unkempt or wearing oddly matched clothes Peculiar style of speech, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or rambling oddly during conversations  Signs and symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as increased interest in solitary activities or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years. The child may be an underperformer in school or appear socially out of step with peers, which may result in teasing or bullying. Schizotypal personality disorder vs. schizophrenia Schizotypal personality disorder can easily be confused with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness in which people lose contact with reality (psychosis). While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations, the episodes are not as frequent, prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia. Another key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe.",883

You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and the virus remains contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over.

"Signs and symptoms of sinus headaches may include:   Pain, pressure and fullness in the cheeks, brow or forehead Worsening pain if you bend forward or lie down Stuffy nose Fatigue Achy feeling in the upper teeth  Sinusitis or migraine? Migraines and headaches from sinusitis are easy to confuse because the signs and symptoms of the two types of headaches may overlap. Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms — including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that most people who see a health care provider for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead. Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light — all common features of migraines. Sinusitis usually:  Occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold Includes thick, discolored nasal mucus Is associated with a decreased sense of smell Causes pain in one cheek or upper teeth   Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer, and migraines most commonly last hours to a day or two.",908

"Signs and symptoms of small bowel cancer include:  Abdominal pain Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) Feeling unusually weak or tired Nausea Vomiting Losing weight without trying Blood in the stool, which might appear red or black Watery diarrhea Skin flushing  Causes Doctors aren't certain what causes most small bowel cancers. In general, small bowel cancer begins when healthy cells in the small bowel develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains a set of instructions that tell a cell what to do. Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally. But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide — even when new cells aren't needed. As these cells accumulate, they form a tumor. With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of small bowel cancer include:  Gene mutations passed through families. Some gene mutations that are inherited from your parents can increase your risk of small bowel cancer and other cancers. Examples include Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Other bowel diseases. Other diseases and conditions that affect the intestines may increase the risk of small bowel cancer, including Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Weakened immune system. If your body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened, you may have an increased risk of small bowel cancer. Examples include people with HIV infection and those who take anti-rejection medicine after an organ transplant.  Complications Small bowel cancer can cause complications, including:  An increased risk of other cancers. People who have small bowel cancer run a higher risk of having other types of cancers, including those that affect the colon, rectum, ovaries and the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body. Advanced small bowel cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most often the liver.  Prevention It's not clear what may help to reduce the risk of small bowel cancer, since it's very uncommon. If you're interested in reducing your risk of cancer in general, it may help to:  Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get an array of vitamins and nutrients. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger. Stop smoking. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit that may work for you. Exercise most days of the week. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. Maintain a healthy weight. If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy ways to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by increasing the amount of exercise you get and reducing the number of calories you eat.

"Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA:  Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness Difficulty concentrating Morning headaches Sore throat upon awakening Restless sleep Gasping or choking at night High blood pressure Chest pain at night Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school  OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep.",919

"The two main features of amnesia are:  Trouble learning new information. Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information.  Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia. Additional symptoms Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include:  False memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time. Confusion or disorientation. ",41

The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages, and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap, and symptoms don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis without noticing any symptoms for years. Primary syphilis The first sign of syphilis is a small sore, called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre, some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre because it's usually painless, and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Secondary syphilis Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing, you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body — even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss, muscle aches, a fever, a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. Latent syphilis If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage, when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. Tertiary syphilis About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who don't get treatment will develop complications known as tertiary syphilis. In the late stage, the disease may damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints. These problems may occur many years after the original, untreated infection. Neurosyphilis At any stage, syphilis can spread and, among other damage, cause damage to the brain and nervous system and the eye. Congenital syphilis Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Later signs and symptoms may include deafness, teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses. However, babies born with syphilis can also be born too early, may die in the womb before birth or can die after birth.",964

"Huntington's disease usually causes movement, cognitive and psychiatric disorders with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. Which symptoms appear first varies greatly from person to person. Some symptoms appear more dominant or have a greater effect on functional ability, but that can change throughout the course of the disease. Movement disorders The movement disorders associated with Huntington's disease can include both involuntary movement problems and impairments in voluntary movements, such as:  Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea) Muscle problems, such as rigidity or muscle contracture (dystonia) Slow or unusual eye movements Impaired gait, posture and balance Difficulty with speech or swallowing  Impairments in voluntary movements — rather than involuntary movements — may have a greater impact on a person's ability to work, perform daily activities, communicate and remain independent. Cognitive disorders Cognitive impairments often associated with Huntington's disease include:  Difficulty organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks Lack of flexibility or the tendency to get stuck on a thought, behavior or action (perseveration) Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words Difficulty in learning new information  Psychiatric disorders The most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of injury to the brain and subsequent changes in brain function. Signs and symptoms may include:  Feelings of irritability, sadness or apathy Social withdrawal Insomnia Fatigue and loss of energy Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide  Other common psychiatric disorders include:  Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania  In addition to the above disorders, weight loss is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease progresses. Symptoms of juvenile Huntington's disease The start and progression of Huntington's disease in younger people may be slightly different from that in adults. Problems that often present early in the course of the disease include: Behavioral changes  Difficulty paying attention Rapid, significant drop in overall school performance Behavioral problems  Physical changes  Contracted and rigid muscles that affect gait (especially in young children) Tremors or slight involuntary movements Frequent falls or clumsiness Seizures ",490

"The most common symptom associated with the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasms or freezing. Causes In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect. Some athletes become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to execute a skill, such as putting, is impaired. ""Choking"" is an extreme form of performance anxiety that may compromise a golfer's or any athlete's game.

"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include:  Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscles Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu  Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories:  Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.  Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist.  Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. ",350

"Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:  An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)  Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:  A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)  Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:  Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years ",319

"The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include:  Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscles  Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:  High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating  Localized tetanus This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. Cephalic tetanus This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus.",977

"The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:  Chest pain when you breathe or cough Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older) Cough, which may produce phlegm Fatigue Fever, sweating and shaking chills Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems) Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Shortness of breath  Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:  Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system  For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.",766

"Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa — often simply called anorexia — is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia nervosa Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa — commonly called bulimia — is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. Binge-eating disorder When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full. After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese. Rumination disorder Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems.",327

The adults then produce larvae that move through the bloodstream to muscle tissues, shown here. Signs and symptoms of trichinosis infection and how severe the infection is can vary. This depends on the number of larvae eaten in the infected meat. Possibly no signs or symptoms Mild cases of trichinosis — those with only a small number of parasites in your body — may cause no signs or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation ⸺ a large number of parasites in your body. These symptoms sometimes get worse as the roundworm (trichinella) larvae travel through your body. Initial signs and symptoms You swallow roundworm (trichinella) larvae in tiny sacks (cysts) containing the parasite. Your digestive juices dissolve the cysts, releasing the larvae into your body. The larvae then enter the wall of your small intestine, where they grow into adult worms and mate. Digestive symptoms can begin 1 to 2 days after infection. At this stage, you may experience:  Diarrhea Stomach (abdominal) pain Severe tiredness and weakness (fatigue) Nausea and vomiting  Later signs and symptoms About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae. The larvae go through the wall of your intestine and enter your bloodstream, They travel around the body and bury themselves in muscle tissue. Here, each larva coils up and forms a cyst around itself. The larvae can live for months to years inside the muscle tissue. Symptoms caused by muscle tissue invasion usually start 2 to 8 weeks after infection and include:  High fever and chills Muscle pain and tenderness Aching joints Swelling of the eyelids or face Weakness Headache Sensitivity to light Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Itchy, irritated skin  With a large number of parasites, muscle pain and weakness can be severe. This can limit moving, breathing and speaking. Symptoms last for several months. But symptoms generally lessen when the larvae form cysts. Even after the infection is gone, fatigue, mild pain, weakness and diarrhea may last for months or years.",1010

The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.  Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.

"Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:  Tender, warm, swollen joints Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite  Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include:  Skin Eyes Lungs Heart Kidneys Salivary glands Nerve tissue Bone marrow Blood vessels  Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.",859

"Plague is divided into three main types — bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic — depending on which part of your body is involved. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of plague. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is the most common variety of the disease. It's named after the swollen lymph nodes (buboes) that typically develop in the first week after you become infected. Buboes may be:  Situated in the groin, armpit or neck About the size of a chicken egg Tender and firm to the touch   Other bubonic plague signs and symptoms may include:  Sudden onset of fever and chills Headache Fatigue or malaise Muscle aches  Septicemic plague Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in your bloodstream. Signs and symptoms include:  Fever and chills Extreme weakness Abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting Bleeding from your mouth, nose or rectum, or under your skin Shock Blackening and death of tissue (gangrene) in your extremities, most commonly your fingers, toes and nose  Pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. It's the least common variety of plague but the most dangerous, because it can be spread from person to person via cough droplets. Signs and symptoms can begin within a few hours after infection, and may include:  Cough, with bloody mucus (sputum) Difficulty breathing Nausea and vomiting High fever Headache Weakness Chest pain  Pneumonic plague progresses rapidly and may cause respiratory failure and shock within two days of infection. Pneumonic plague needs to be treated with antibiotics within a day after signs and symptoms first appear, or the infection is likely to be fatal.",763

"Priapism symptoms vary depending on the type of priapism. The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the veins of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscles within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complications caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue. Signs and symptoms include:  Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressively worsening penile pain  Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood. Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the arteries of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma. Signs and symptoms include:  Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft Usually not painful ",804

Penicillin allergy signs and symptoms may include:  Skin rash Hives Itching Fever Swelling Shortness of breath Wheezing Runny nose Itchy, watery eyes Anaphylaxis  Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction that causes the widespread dysfunction of body systems. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  Tightening of the airways and throat, causing trouble breathing Nausea or abdominal cramps Vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or lightheadedness Weak, rapid pulse Drop in blood pressure Seizures Loss of consciousness  Delayed reactions resulting from penicillin allergy Less-common penicillin allergy reactions occur days or weeks after exposure to the drug and may persist for some time after you stop taking it. These conditions include:  Serum sickness, which may cause fever, joint pain, rash, swelling and nausea Drug-induced anemia, a reduction in red blood cells, which can cause fatigue, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath, and other signs and symptoms Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which results in rash, high white blood cell counts, general swelling, swollen lymph nodes and recurrence of dormant hepatitis infection Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, which involves severe blistering and peeling of the skin Inflammation in the kidneys (nephritis), which can cause fever, blood in the urine, general swelling, confusion, and other signs and symptoms  Adverse events that are not allergic reactions You may experience side effects of penicillin — as happens with other medications — that are not an allergic reaction to the drug. Depending on the type of penicillin, common side effects may include mild nausea or diarrhea, headache, or vaginal itching. Signs or symptoms of an infection for which you are being treated — or unrelated symptoms — also may be mistaken as an allergic drug reaction.",733

"Milk allergy symptoms, which differ from person to person, occur a few minutes to a few hours after you or your child drinks milk or eats milk products. Immediate signs and symptoms of milk allergy might include:  Hives Wheezing Itching or tingling feeling around the lips or mouth Swelling of the lips, tongue or throat Coughing or shortness of breath Vomiting  Signs and symptoms that may take more time to develop include:  Loose stools or diarrhea, which may contain blood Abdominal cramps Runny nose Watery eyes Colic, in babies  Milk allergy or milk intolerance? A true milk allergy differs from milk protein intolerance and lactose intolerance. Unlike milk allergy, intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. Milk intolerance requires different treatment from true milk allergy. Common signs and symptoms of milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance include digestive problems, such as bloating, gas or diarrhea, after consuming milk or products containing milk. Anaphylaxis Milk allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that narrows the airways and can block breathing. Milk is the third most common food — after peanuts and tree nuts — to cause anaphylaxis. If you or your child has a reaction to milk, tell your health care provider, no matter how mild the reaction. Tests can help confirm milk allergy, so you can avoid future and potentially worse reactions. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) shot (EpiPen, Adrenaclick, others) and a trip to the emergency room. Signs and symptoms start soon after milk consumption and can include:  Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat that makes it difficult to breathe Facial flushing Itching Shock, with a marked drop in blood pressure ",634

"Primary progressive aphasia symptoms vary, depending on which portion of the brain's language areas are involved. The condition has three types, which cause different symptoms. Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:  Difficulty comprehending spoken or written language, particularly single words Trouble comprehending word meanings Struggling to name objects  Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:  Difficulty retrieving words and word substitutions Frequently pausing in speech while searching for words Difficulty repeating phrases or sentences  Nonfluent-agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:   Poor grammar in written and spoken form Trouble understanding complex sentences Using grammar incorrectly May be accompanied by speaking problems such as errors in speech sounds (known as apraxia of speech)  Causes Primary progressive aphasia is caused by a shrinking (atrophy) of certain sections (lobes) of the brain responsible for speech and language. In this case, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes, primarily on the left side of the brain, are affected. Atrophy is associated with the presence of abnormal proteins, and brain activity or function in affected areas might be reduced. Risk factors Risk factors for primary progressive aphasia include:  Learning disabilities. If you had a childhood learning disability, particularly developmental dyslexia, you might be at somewhat higher risk of primary progressive aphasia. Certain gene mutations. Rare gene mutations have been linked to the disorder. If other members of your family have had primary progressive aphasia, you might be more likely to develop it.  Complications People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write, and to understand written and spoken language. Some people develop substantial difficulty forming sounds to speak (a problem called apraxia of speech), even when their ability to write and comprehend are not significantly impaired. As the disease progresses, other mental skills, such as memory, can become impaired. Some people develop other neurological symptoms such as problems with movement. With these complications, the affected person eventually will need help with day-to-day care. People with primary progressive aphasia can also develop depression or behavioral or social problems as the disease progresses. Other problems might include blunted emotions such as unconcern, poor judgment or inappropriate social behavior.

Most sacral dimples are small and shallow. A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back — usually just above the crease between the buttocks. Most sacral dimples are small and shallow. A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back. It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks. Causes There are no known causes for a sacral dimple. It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth. Complications Rarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include:  Spina bifida. A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn't need treatment. Tethered cord syndrome. The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.  The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration                  By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment Request an appointment   Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment       Oct. 07, 2022   Print Print  Share on: FacebookTwitter Facebook Twitter Show references Paller AS, et al.

"A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following:  Enlarged hands and feet Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue Coarse, oily, thickened skin Excessive sweating and body odor Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags) Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness Pain and limited joint mobility A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway Vision problems Headaches, which may be persistent or severe Menstrual cycle irregularities in women Erectile dysfunction in men Loss of interest in sex ",9

They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it. Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person. Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party. Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them. The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen.

Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Risk factors Adrenal cancer happens more often in people with inherited syndromes that increase the risk of certain cancers. These inherited syndromes include:  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Carney complex Li-Fraumeni syndrome Lynch syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)  By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff  Adrenal cancer care at Mayo Clinic ",21

"Symptoms of PCOS often start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while. PCOS The symptoms of PCOS vary. A diagnosis of PCOS is made when you have at least two of these: PCOS PCOS  Irregular periods. Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs of PCOS. So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. You may have trouble getting pregnant. Too much androgen. High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism. Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too. Polycystic ovaries. Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. The ovaries might not work the way they should.  PCOS signs and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity.",726

"Most people exposed to the cholera bacterium (Vibrio cholerae) don't become ill and don't know they've been infected. But because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water. Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Symptoms of cholera infection can include:  Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat.   Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as:  Muscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium. Shock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes. ",204

This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:  A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin  Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:  A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.  Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include:  Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. ",609

During prenatal visits, your health care provider might measure your fundal height — the distance from the top of your uterus to your pubic bone. A larger than expected fundal height could be a sign of fetal macrosomia.  Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Having too much amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy — might be a sign that your baby is larger than average.      The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine. Some conditions that cause a baby to be larger might also increase his or her urine output.

Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer. HPV HPV HPV HPV Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.",489

"The most common sign of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. Episodes of a fast heart rate (tachycardia) can begin suddenly and may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes can occur during exercise or while at rest. Other signs and symptoms of WPW syndrome are related to the fast heart rate and underlying heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia). The most common arrhythmia seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a fast, pounding heartbeat that begin and end abruptly. Some people with WPW syndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation. WPW WPW WPW In general, signs and symptoms that may occur in people with WPW syndrome include: WPW  A rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeat (palpitations) Chest pain Difficulty breathing Dizziness or lightheadedness Fainting Fatigue Shortness of breath Anxiety  Symptoms in infants Signs and symptoms of WPW syndrome in infants can include: WPW  Pale or faded skin color (pallor) Blue or gray coloring to the skin, lips and nails (cyanosis) Restlessness or irritability Rapid breathing Poor eating  Some people with an extra electrical pathway don't have signs or symptoms of a fast heartbeat. This condition is called Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern. It's often discovered by chance during a heart test.",1074

"Signs and symptoms of acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take many years to develop. They usually happen because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. Pressure from the tumor on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles and sensation (facial and trigeminal nerves), nearby blood vessels, or brain structures may also cause problems. As the tumor grows, it may cause more noticeable or severe signs and symptoms. Common signs and symptoms of acoustic neuroma include:  Hearing loss, usually gradually worsening over months to years — although in rare cases sudden — and occurring on only one side or more severe on one side Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear Unsteadiness or loss of balance Dizziness (vertigo) Facial numbness and weakness or loss of muscle movement  In rare cases, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. When to see your doctor See your doctor if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or trouble with your balance. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause serious consequences, such as total hearing loss.",8

"Signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may include:  Weakness in your legs, ankles and feet Loss of muscle bulk in your legs and feet High foot arches Curled toes (hammertoes) Decreased ability to run Difficulty lifting your foot at the ankle (footdrop) Awkward or higher than normal step (gait) Frequent tripping or falling Decreased sensation or a loss of feeling in your legs and feet  As Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease progresses, symptoms may spread from the feet and legs to the hands and arms. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, even among family members. Causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited, genetic condition. It occurs when there are mutations in the genes that affect the nerves in your feet, legs, hands and arms. Sometimes, these mutations damage the nerves. Other mutations damage the protective coating that surrounds the nerve (myelin sheath). Both cause weaker messages to travel between your limbs and brain. Risk factors Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is hereditary, so you're at higher risk of developing the disorder if anyone in your immediate family has the disease. Other causes of neuropathies, such as diabetes, may cause symptoms similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These other conditions can also cause the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to become worse. Medications such as the chemotherapy drugs vincristine (Marqibo), paclitaxel (Abraxane) and others can make symptoms worse. Be sure to let your doctor know about all of the medications you're taking. Complications Complications of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity from person to person. Foot abnormalities and difficulty walking are usually the most serious problems. Muscles may get weaker, and you may injure areas of the body that experience decreased sensation. Sometimes the muscles in your feet may not receive your brain's signal to contract, so you're more likely to trip and fall. And your brain may not receive pain messages from your feet, so if you've rubbed a blister on your toe, for example, it may get infected without your realizing it. You may also experience difficulty breathing, swallowing or speaking if the muscles that control these functions are affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

"Most septal displacements result in no symptoms, and you may not even know you have a deviated septum. Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following signs and symptoms:  Obstruction of one or both nostrils. This blockage can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils. You may notice this more when you have a cold or allergies that can cause your nasal passages to swell and narrow. Nosebleeds. The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds. Facial pain. There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain. A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surfaces within the nose touch and cause pressure. Noisy breathing during sleep. A deviated septum or swelling of the tissues in your nose can be one of the many reasons for noisy breathing during sleep. Awareness of the nasal cycle. The nose alternates between being obstructed on one side and then changes to being obstructed on the other. This is called the nasal cycle. Being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction. Preference for sleeping on a particular side. Some people may prefer to sleep on a particular side to optimize breathing through the nose at night if one nasal passage is narrowed. ",283

"There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include:  Overly flexible joints. Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Fragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly.  Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture. Causes Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children. Complications Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. Prevention If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.

Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin. Types of heat rash The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.  The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily. A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area. Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa. A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open. ",455

"Symptoms of porphyria can vary widely in severity, by type and among individuals. Some people with the gene mutations that cause porphyria never have any symptoms. Acute porphyrias Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that typically cause nervous system symptoms, which appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last days to weeks and usually improve slowly after the attack. Acute intermittent porphyria is the common form of acute porphyria. Signs and symptoms of acute porphyria may include:  Severe abdominal pain Pain in your chest, legs or back Constipation or diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis Red or brown urine Mental changes, such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, disorientation or paranoia Breathing problems Urination problems Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel (palpitations) High blood pressure Seizures  Cutaneous porphyrias Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight, but these forms don't usually affect your nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias. As a result of sun exposure, you may experience:  Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain Sudden painful skin redness (erythema) and swelling (edema Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color (pigment) Itching Excessive hair growth in affected areas Red or brown urine ",780

Most likely, you'll experience some irregularity in your periods before they end. Skipping periods during perimenopause is common and expected. Often, menstrual periods will skip a month and return, or skip several months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. Periods also tend to happen on shorter cycles, so they are closer together. Despite irregular periods, pregnancy is possible.

"Leukoplakia usually occurs on your gums, the insides of your cheeks, the bottom of your mouth — beneath the tongue — and, sometimes, your tongue. It isn't usually painful and may go unnoticed for a while. Leukoplakia may appear:  White or grayish in patches that can't be wiped away Irregular or flat-textured Thickened or hardened in areas Along with raised, red lesions (speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia), which are more likely to show precancerous changes  Hairy leukoplakia Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that resemble folds or ridges, usually on the sides of your tongue. It's often mistaken for oral thrush, an infection marked by creamy white patches that can be wiped away, which is also common in people with a weakened immune system. When to see a doctor Even though leukoplakia doesn't usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can indicate a more serious condition. See your dentist or primary care professional if you have any of the following:  White plaques or sores in your mouth that don't heal on their own within two weeks      Lumps or white, red or dark patches in your mouth      Persistent changes in the tissues of your mouth      Ear pain when swallowing      Progressive reduction in the ability to open your jaw      ",572

"Signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia can be different from one individual to the next. Signs and symptoms get progressively worse over time, usually over years. Clusters of symptom types tend to occur together, and people may have more than one cluster of symptom types. Behavioral changes The most common signs of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality. These include:  Increasingly inappropriate social behavior Loss of empathy and other interpersonal skills, such as having sensitivity to another's feelings Lack of judgment Loss of inhibition Lack of interest (apathy), which can be mistaken for depression Repetitive compulsive behavior, such as tapping, clapping or smacking lips A decline in personal hygiene Changes in eating habits, usually overeating or developing a preference for sweets and carbohydrates Eating inedible objects Compulsively wanting to put things in the mouth  Speech and language problems Some subtypes of frontotemporal dementia lead to language problems or impairment or loss of speech. Primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia and progressive agrammatic (nonfluent) aphasia are all considered to be frontotemporal dementia. Problems caused by these conditions include:  Increasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language, such as having trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects Trouble naming things, possibly replacing a specific word with a more general word such as ""it"" for pen No longer knowing word meanings Having hesitant speech that may sound telegraphic Making mistakes in sentence construction  Motor disorders Rarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement similar to those associated with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Motor-related problems may include:  Tremor Rigidity Muscle spasms or twitches Poor coordination Difficulty swallowing Muscle weakness Inappropriate laughing or crying Falls or walking problems  Causes In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink. In addition, certain substances accumulate in the brain. What causes these changes is usually unknown. There are genetic mutations that have been linked to frontotemporal dementia. But more than half of the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia. Recently, researchers have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathways between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More research needs to be done to understand the connection between these conditions, however. Risk factors Your risk of developing frontotemporal dementia is higher if you have a family history of dementia. There are no other known risk factors.

"Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feels sharp or stabbing. However, some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain. Pericarditis pain usually occurs behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may:  Spread to the left shoulder and neck Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath Get better when sitting up or leaning forward  Other signs and symptoms of pericarditis may include:  Cough Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick Leg swelling Low-grade fever Pounding or racing heartbeat (heart palpitations) Shortness of breath when lying down Swelling of the belly (abdomen)  The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last.  Acute pericarditis begins suddenly but doesn't last longer than three weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be difficult to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. Recurrent pericarditis occurs about four to six weeks after an episode of acute pericarditis with no symptoms in between. Incessant pericarditis lasts about four to six weeks but less than three months. The symptoms are continuous. Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months. ",738

Egg allergy symptoms can include:  Skin inflammation or hives — the most common egg allergy reaction Nasal congestion, runny nose and sneezing (allergic rhinitis) Digestive symptoms, such as cramps, nausea and vomiting Asthma signs and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or shortness of breath  Anaphylaxis A severe allergic reaction can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening emergency that requires an immediate epinephrine (adrenaline) shot and a trip to the emergency room. Anaphylaxis signs and symptoms include:  Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat or a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe Abdominal pain and cramping Rapid pulse Shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure felt as dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness  Discuss with your doctor any reaction — no matter how mild — you or your child has to eggs. The severity of egg allergy reactions can vary each time one occurs, so even if a past reaction was mild, the next one could be more serious. If your doctor thinks you or your child may be at risk of a severe reaction, he or she may prescribe an emergency epinephrine shot to be used if anaphylaxis occurs. The shot comes in a device that makes it easy to deliver, called an autoinjector.",332

However, the symptoms tend to progress over time, usually reaching their worst within a few years after the onset of the disease. Although myasthenia gravis can affect any of the muscles that you control voluntarily, certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others. Eye muscles In more than half of people who develop myasthenia gravis, their first signs and symptoms involve eye problems, such as:  Drooping of one or both eyelids (ptosis) Double vision (diplopia), which may be horizontal or vertical, and improves or resolves when one eye is closed  Face and throat muscles In about 15% of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles, which can:  Impair speaking. Your speech might sound soft or nasal, depending on which muscles have been affected. Cause difficulty swallowing. You might choke easily, making it difficult to eat, drink or take pills. In some cases, liquids you're trying to swallow come out your nose. Affect chewing.

"Signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome may vary among girls and women with the disorder. For some girls, the presence of Turner syndrome may not be readily apparent, but in other girls, several physical features are apparent early. Signs and symptoms can be subtle, developing slowly over time, or significant, such as heart defects. Before birth Turner syndrome may be suspected prenatally based on prenatal cell-free DNA screening ― a method to screen for certain chromosomal abnormalities in a developing baby using a blood sample from the mother ― or prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal ultrasound of a baby with Turner syndrome may show:  Large fluid collection on the back of the neck or other abnormal fluid collections (edema) Heart abnormalities Abnormal kidneys  At birth or during infancy Signs of Turner syndrome at birth or during infancy may include:  Wide or weblike neck Low-set ears Broad chest with widely spaced nipples High, narrow roof of the mouth (palate) Arms that turn outward at the elbows Fingernails and toenails that are narrow and turned upward Swelling of the hands and feet, especially at birth Slightly smaller than average height at birth Slowed growth Cardiac defects Low hairline at the back of the head Receding or small lower jaw Short fingers and toes  In childhood, teens and adulthood The most common signs in almost all girls, teenagers and young women with Turner syndrome are short stature and ovarian insufficiency due to ovarian failure. Failure of the ovaries to develop may occur at birth or gradually during childhood, the teen years or young adulthood. Signs and symptoms of these include:  Slowed growth No growth spurts at expected times in childhood Adult height significantly less than might be expected for a female member of the family Failure to begin sexual changes expected during puberty Sexual development that ""stalls"" during teenage years Early end to menstrual cycles not due to pregnancy For most females with Turner syndrome, inability to conceive a child without fertility treatment ",1021

"Bladder exstrophy is the most common in the larger group of birth defects called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following: BEEC  Epispadias. This is the least severe form of BEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.  Bladder exstrophy. This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur. Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way — from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias.   Cloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well. The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.  ",114

"The typical mole is a small brown spot. But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes:  Color and texture. Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. Shape. Most moles are oval or round. Size. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb.  Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger. Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: ABCDE  A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.  Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. ",643

"Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others:  Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug  Recognizing unhealthy drug use in family members Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include:  Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to support drug use  Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you'll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Major cravings for certain foods at unusual times  Long-term use is often associated with:  Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Ongoing cough and frequent lung infections  K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than ""natural"" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a ""high"" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Violent behavior  Substituted cathinones, also called ""bath salts,"" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Feeling ""high"" Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior  Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to ""switch off"" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings.  Barbiturates. An example is phenobarbital. Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata).  Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness  Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). They're often used and misused in search of a ""high,"" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Feeling of happy excitement and too much confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Poor judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (""meth mouth"") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off  Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. Other examples include ketamine and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol ― a brand used outside the U.S. ― also called roofie. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. GHB Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include:  Hallucinations Paranoia Larger than usual pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure  Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: LSD  Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations — even years later  PCP use may cause: PCP  A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Poor judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma  Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include:  Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief happy excitement Behaving as if drunk Reduced ability to keep impulses under control Aggressive behavior or eagerness to fight Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth  Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone.

"Primary hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed before signs or symptoms of the disorder occur. This is usually because an elevated level of calcium is found on routine blood tests. When symptoms do occur, they're the result of damage or dysfunction in other organs or tissues. This damage or dysfunction is due to high calcium levels in the blood and urine or too little calcium in bones. Symptoms may be so mild and nonspecific that they don't seem related to parathyroid function, or they may be severe. The range of signs and symptoms include:  Weak bones that break easily (osteoporosis) Kidney stones Excessive urination Stomach (abdominal) pain Tiring easily or weakness Depression or forgetfulness Bone and joint pain Frequent complaints of illness with no clear cause Nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite ",499

It can occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to something you're allergic to ⸺ and worsens quickly. An anaphylactic reaction to shellfish is a medical emergency. Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection and a follow-up trip to the emergency room. If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal. Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  A swollen throat or tongue or a tightness in the throat (airway constriction) that makes it difficult for you to breathe Coughing, choking or wheezing with trouble breathing Shock, with a severe drop in your blood pressure and a rapid or weak pulse Severe skin rash, hives, itching or swelling Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting ",901

"Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others. People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems  Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff  Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others. People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as:  Exaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true. Making up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness. Faking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Causing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts. Tampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances.

"Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include:  Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. Increased blurriness of printed words. Difficulty recognizing faces. A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.  Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years.

"Signs and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder include:  Being extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw in appearance that to others can't be seen or appears minor Strong belief that you have a defect in your appearance that makes you ugly or deformed Belief that others take special notice of your appearance in a negative way or mock you Engaging in behaviors aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flaw that are difficult to resist or control, such as frequently checking the mirror, grooming or skin picking Attempting to hide perceived flaws with styling, makeup or clothes Constantly comparing your appearance with others Frequently seeking reassurance about your appearance from others Having perfectionist tendencies Seeking cosmetic procedures with little satisfaction Avoiding social situations  Preoccupation with your appearance and excessive thoughts and repetitive behaviors can be unwanted, difficult to control and so time-consuming that they can cause major distress or problems in your social life, work, school or other areas of functioning. You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body. The bodily feature that you focus on may change over time. The most common features people tend to fixate about include:  Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes Hair, such as appearance, thinning and baldness Skin and vein appearance Breast size Muscle size and tone Genitalia  A preoccupation with your body build being too small or not muscular enough (muscle dysmorphia) occurs almost exclusively in males. Insight about body dysmorphic disorder varies. You may recognize that your beliefs about your perceived flaws may be excessive or not be true, or think that they probably are true, or be absolutely convinced that they're true. The more convinced you are of your beliefs, the more distress and disruption you may experience in your life.",120

"There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.  Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.  Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:  Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired Increased activity, energy or agitation Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) Decreased need for sleep Unusual talkativeness Racing thoughts Distractibility Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments  Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms:  Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) Either insomnia or sleeping too much Either restlessness or slowed behavior Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide  Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings.",111

Signs and symptoms of FMF attacks vary, but can include: FMF  Fever Abdominal pain Chest pain, which can make it hard to breathe deeply Painful, swollen joints, usually in the knees, ankles and hips A red rash on your legs, especially below your knees Muscle aches A swollen, tender scrotum  The attacks generally resolve spontaneously after a few days. Between attacks, you'll likely feel back to your typical health. Symptom-free periods may be as short as a few days or as long as several years. In some people, the first sign of FMF is amyloidosis. With amyloidosis, the protein amyloid A, which is not typically found in the body, builds up in organs ⸺ especially the kidneys ⸺ causing inflammation and interfering with their function.",368

"Vaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don't menstruate (amenorrhea). Other signs of puberty usually follow typical female development. Vaginal agenesis may have these features:  The genitals look like a typical female. The vagina may be shortened without a cervix at the end, or absent and marked only by a slight indentation where a vaginal opening would typically be located. There may be no uterus or one that's only partially developed. If there's tissue lining the uterus (endometrium), monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur. The ovaries typically are fully developed and functional, but they may be in an unusual location in the abdomen. Sometimes the pair of tubes that eggs travel through to get from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) are absent or do not develop typically.  Vaginal agenesis may also be associated with other issues, such as:  Problems with development of the kidneys and urinary tract Developmental changes in the bones of the spine, ribs and wrists Hearing problems Other congenital conditions that also involve the heart, gastrointestinal tract and limb growth ",1041

"The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years of the disorder. Then they continue for life. They include:   Excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning. It can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again. You also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function. Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. You might continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.   Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles. Symptoms may last up to a few minutes. Cataplexy can't be controlled. It's triggered by intense emotions. Often the emotions that cause cataplexy are positive. Laughter or excitement may cause the symptoms. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.   Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy often experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, you can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. It's usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.  Hallucinations. Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.  Other characteristics People with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders. They might have obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing starts and stops during the night. Or they may act out their dreams, known as REM sleep behavior disorder. Or they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, called insomnia.",668

"Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection. This initial, acute illness can develop into a more serious disease, including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Acute coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) The initial, or acute, form of coccidioidomycosis is often mild, with few or no symptoms. Signs and symptoms occur one to three weeks after exposure. They tend to be similar to flu symptoms. Symptoms can range from minor to severe, including:  Fever Cough Tiredness Shortness of breath Headache Chills Night sweats Joint aches and muscle soreness Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back  If you don't become ill or have symptoms from valley fever, you may only find out you've been infected later. You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small areas of residual infection in the lungs (nodules) show up on a routine chest X-ray. The nodules typically don't cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X-rays. If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale. Chronic coccidioidomycosis If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms include:  Low-grade fever Weight loss Cough Chest pain Blood-tinged sputum (matter discharged during coughing) Nodules in the lungs  Disseminated coccidioidomycosis The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include:  Nodules, ulcers and skin lesions that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with initial infection Painful lesions in the skull, spine or other bones Painful, swollen joints, especially in the knees or ankles Meningitis — an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord ",1045

"Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on which nerves are damaged. They might include:  Dizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure. Urinary problems, such as difficulty starting urination, loss of bladder control, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder. Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections. Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn. These problems are all due to changes in digestive function. Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there. Sweating problems, such as sweating too much or too little. These problems affect the ability to regulate body temperature.

"Signs and symptoms of sarcoma include:  A lump that can be felt through the skin that may or may not be painful Bone pain A broken bone that happens unexpectedly, such as with a minor injury or no injury at all Abdominal pain Weight loss  Causes It's not clear what causes most sarcomas. In general, cancer forms when changes (mutations) happen in the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Mutations might tell cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and to continue living when normal cells would die. If this happens, the accumulating abnormal cells can form a tumor. Cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of sarcoma include:  Inherited syndromes. Some syndromes that increase the risk of cancer can be passed from parents to children. Examples of syndromes that increase the risk of sarcoma include familial retinoblastoma and neurofibromatosis type 1. Radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation treatment for cancer increases the risk of developing a sarcoma later. Chronic swelling (lymphedema). Lymphedema is swelling caused by a backup of lymph fluid that occurs when the lymphatic system is blocked or damaged. It increases the risk of a type of sarcoma called angiosarcoma. Exposure to chemicals. Certain chemicals, such as some industrial chemicals and herbicides, can increase the risk of sarcoma that affects the liver. Exposure to viruses. The virus called human herpesvirus 8 can increase the risk of a type of sarcoma called Kaposi's sarcoma in people with weakened immune systems.

"Symptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within 3 to 5 weeks after birth. Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months. Symptoms include:  Vomiting after feeding. The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting might be mild at first. But over time, it becomes more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood. Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis. The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus. Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect. Changes in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated. Weight problems. Pyloric stenosis can keep a baby from gaining weight, and sometimes can cause weight loss. ",831

Staph infection MRSA infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses. MRSA infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses. MRSA Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to life-threatening illness. For example, endocarditis, a serious infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium) can be caused by staph bacteria. Signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include:  Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil. This is a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. Cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin. It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced by the staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition includes a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off. This leaves a red, raw surface that looks like a burn.  Food poisoning Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. The bacteria multiply in food and produce toxins that make you sick. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include:  Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure  Bacteremia Also known as a bloodstream infection, bacteremia occurs when staph bacteria enter the bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of bacteremia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body to cause infections that affect:  Internal organs, such as your brain (meningitis), heart (endocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia) Bones and muscles Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers  Toxic shock syndrome This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria. The condition has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with:  A high fever Nausea and vomiting A rash on your palms and soles that looks like a sunburn Confusion Muscle aches Diarrhea Stomach pain  Septic arthritis Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Artificial joints may also be at risk of infection. Signs and symptoms may include:  Joint swelling Severe pain in the affected joint Fever ",939

"Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of:  Leaving home alone. Crowds or waiting in line. Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train.  These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. In addition:  Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation. You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset. You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance. Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.  Panic disorder and agoraphobia Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack can include:  Rapid heart rate. Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking. Chest pain or pressure. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Feeling shaky, numb or tingling. Sweating too much. Sudden flushing or chills. Upset stomach or diarrhea. Feeling a loss of control. Fear of dying. ",26

Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing. Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:  Headache. Fever. Aches in muscles or joints. Fatigue or weakness.  Typically, these are followed by more-severe symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:  Stiff neck. Confusion, agitation or hallucinations. Seizures. Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body. Irregular movements. Muscle weakness. Problems with speech or hearing. Loss of consciousness, including coma.  In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include:  Bulging in the soft spots of an infant's skull, known as fontanels. Nausea and vomiting. Stiffness affecting the whole body. Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding. Irritability.  In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more-severe symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms including:  Changes in personality. Memory loss. Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis. Seeing or hearing things that aren't there. These are called hallucinations. Seizures. Changes in vision. Sleep problems.

The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis may include:  Eye redness. Eye pain. Light sensitivity. Blurred vision. Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters). Decreased vision.  Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. Occasionally, there are no symptoms, and signs of uveitis are observed on a routine eye exam. The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. When you look at your eye in the mirror, you will see the white part of the eye (sclera) and the colored part of the eye (iris). The iris is located inside the front of the eye. The ciliary body is a structure behind the iris. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera. The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed:  Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous). Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid. Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed, from the front to the back of your eye.  When to seek medical advice Contact your doctor if you think you have the warning signs of uveitis. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). If you're having significant eye pain and unexpected vision problems, seek immediate medical attention.",1040

Having a moderate reaction doesn't mean you'll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you're stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they're stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. Severe allergic reaction A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin Difficulty breathing Swelling of the throat and tongue A weak, rapid pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting Loss of consciousness  People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (""allergy shots"") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again. Multiple bee stings Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. In some cases a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bees and get multiple stings. Some types of bees — such as Africanized honeybees — are more likely than are other bees to swarm, stinging in a group. If you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick. Signs and symptoms include:  Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Headache A feeling of spinning (vertigo) Convulsions Fever Dizziness or fainting  Multiple stings can be a medical emergency in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems.",105

"Signs and symptoms of trichotillomania often include:  Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair  Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips. Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others. For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:  Focused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress — for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs. Automatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.  The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair. Trichotillomania can be related to emotions:  Negative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration. Positive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.  Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting. When to see a doctor If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor. Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment.",1012

"The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect. When to see a doctor If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists. It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition.",817
"A specific phobia involves an intense, persistent fear of a specific object or situation that's out of proportion to the actual risk. There are many types of phobias, and it's not unusual to experience a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias can also occur along with other types of anxiety disorders.   Common categories of specific phobias are a fear of:  Situations, such as airplanes, enclosed spaces or going to school Nature, such as thunderstorms or heights Animals or insects, such as dogs or spiders Blood, injection or injury, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures Others, such as choking, vomiting, loud noises or clowns  Each specific phobia is referred to by its own term. Examples of more common terms include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. No matter what specific phobia you have, it's likely to produce these types of reactions:  An immediate feeling of intense fear, anxiety and panic when exposed to or even thinking about the source of your fear Awareness that your fears are unreasonable or exaggerated but feeling powerless to control them Worsening anxiety as the situation or object gets closer to you in time or physical proximity Doing everything possible to avoid the object or situation or enduring it with intense anxiety or fear Difficulty functioning normally because of your fear Physical reactions and sensations, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or difficulty breathing Feeling nauseated, dizzy or fainting around blood or injuries In children, possibly tantrums, clinging, crying, or refusing to leave a parent's side or approach their fear  When to see a doctor When to see a doctor An unreasonable fear can be an annoyance — having to take the stairs instead of an elevator or driving the long way to work instead of taking the freeway, for instance — but it isn't considered a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects functioning in work, school or social situations, talk with your doctor or a mental health professional. Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, of monsters or of being left alone, are common, and most children outgrow them. But if your child has a persistent, excessive fear that interferes with daily functioning at home or school, talk to your child's doctor. Most people can be helped with the right therapy. And therapy tends to be easier when the phobia is addressed right away rather than waiting.",925

"The muscle contractions involved in cervical dystonia can cause your head to twist in a variety of directions, including:  Chin toward shoulder Ear toward shoulder Chin straight up Chin straight down  The most common type of twisting associated with cervical dystonia is when your chin is pulled toward your shoulder. Some people experience a combination of abnormal head postures. A jerking motion of the head also may occur. Many people who have cervical dystonia also experience neck pain that can radiate into the shoulders. The disorder can also cause headaches. In some people, the pain from cervical dystonia can be exhausting and disabling. Causes In most people with cervical dystonia, the cause is unknown. Some people who have cervical dystonia have a family history of the disorder. Researchers have found gene mutations associated with cervical dystonia. Cervical dystonia is also sometimes linked to head, neck or shoulder injuries. Risk factors Risk factors for cervical dystonia include:  Age. While the disorder can occur in people of any age, it most commonly begins after age 30. Your sex. Women are more likely to develop cervical dystonia than are men. Family history. If a close family member has cervical dystonia or some other type of dystonia, you are at higher risk of developing the disorder.  Complications In some cases, the involuntary muscle contractions associated with cervical dystonia can spread to nearby areas of your body. The most common locations include the face, jaw, arms and trunk. People who have cervical dystonia may also develop bone spurs that may reduce the amount of space in the spinal canal. This can cause tingling, numbness and weakness in the arms, hands, legs or feet.

"Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include:  Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms  Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.  Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death. Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.  What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these:  12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol) ",32

"Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be mild and go unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides. Parkinson's signs and symptoms may include:  Tremor. A tremor, or rhythmic shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks. Slowed movement (bradykinesia). Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk. Rigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion. Impaired posture and balance. Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease. Loss of automatic movements. You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk. Speech changes. You may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns. Writing changes. It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small. ",720

"The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, often associated with menstrual periods. Although many experience cramping during their menstrual periods, those with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. Pain also may increase over time. Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis include:  Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before and extend several days into a menstrual period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain. Pain with intercourse. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis. Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to experience these symptoms during a menstrual period. Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding). Infertility. Sometimes, endometriosis is first diagnosed in those seeking treatment for infertility. Other signs and symptoms. You may experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods.  The severity of your pain may not be a reliable indicator of the extent of your condition. You could have mild endometriosis with severe pain, or you could have advanced endometriosis with little or no pain. Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping. IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis.",341
"Body temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever. Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:  Sweating Chills and shivering Headache Muscle aches Loss of appetite Irritability Dehydration General weakness  Taking a temperature To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers. Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements. In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.",376

Symptoms include:  Constipation, which is often the first symptom Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head Weak cry Irritability Drooling Drooping eyelids Tiredness Trouble sucking or feeding Paralysis  Certain symptoms don't typically occur with botulism. For example, botulism doesn't usually raise blood pressure or heart rate or cause fever or confusion. Sometimes, though, wound botulism may cause fever. Iatrogenic botulism In iatrogenic botulism — when the toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons — there have been rare occurrences of serious side effects.

"The primary features of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD ADHD ADHD ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive. ADHD There are three subtypes of ADHD: ADHD  Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.  Inattention A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often:  Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores Have trouble organizing tasks and activities Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores  Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often:  Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities  Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. ADHD Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected.",19

"People who have KTS may have the following features, which can range from mild to more extensive: KTS  Port-wine stain. This pink to reddish-purple birthmark is caused by extra tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the top layer of skin. The birthmark often covers part of one leg but can involve any portion of the skin. It may get darker or lighter with age. Vein malformations. These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin. Malformed veins may become more prominent with age. Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue. This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes. Lymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid — can be malformed. Extra lymphatic vessels can be present that don't work properly and can lead to fluid leakage into the tissues and swelling. Other conditions. KTS can also include cataracts, glaucoma, hip dislocation at birth, purple-red skin coloring when cold and blood-clotting problems. ",559

"The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include:  Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines. Nausea or vomiting. Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision. Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg. Trouble with balance. Speech problems. Feeling very tired. Confusion in everyday matters. Memory problems. Having trouble following simple commands. Personality or behavior changes. Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures. Hearing problems. Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo. Feeling very hungry and gaining weight.  Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. The symptoms might get worse over months or years. Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of days or weeks. Brain tumor headaches Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache. Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feels like a migraine. Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain.

Brain tumors in different parts of the cerebrum might cause different symptoms.  Brain tumors in the front of the brain. The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain. They control thinking and movement. Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking. There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities. Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different. Brain tumors in the middle of the brain. The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain. They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses. Examples include vision problems and hearing problems. Brain tumors in the back of the brain. The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain. They control vision. Occipital lobe brain tumors can cause vision loss. Brain tumors in the lower part of the brain. The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain. They process memories and senses. Temporal lobe brain tumors can cause memory problems. They might cause someone to see, taste or smell something that isn't there. Sometimes the taste or smell is unpleasant or unusual. ",134

"Signs and symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus infection most commonly appear about four to six days after exposure to the virus. In adults and older children, RSV usually causes mild cold-like signs and symptoms. These may include: RSV  Congested or runny nose Dry cough Low-grade fever Sore throat Sneezing Headache  In severe cases RSV infection can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: RSV  Fever Severe cough Wheezing — a high-pitched noise that's usually heard on breathing out (exhaling) Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing — the person may prefer to sit up rather than lie down Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis)  Infants are most severely affected by RSV. Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include: RSV RSV  Short, shallow and rapid breathing Struggling to breathe — chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath Cough Poor feeding Unusual tiredness (lethargy) Irritability  Most children and adults recover in one to two weeks, although some might have repeated wheezing. Severe or life-threatening infection requiring a hospital stay may occur in premature infants or in anyone who has chronic heart or lung problems. RSV and COVID-19 Because RSV and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both types of respiratory viruses, some symptoms of RSV and COVID-19 can be similar. In children, COVID-19 often results in mild symptoms such as fever, runny nose and cough. For adults with COVID-19, symptoms may be more severe and may include trouble breathing. RSV RSV COVID-19 COVID-19 COVID-19 Having RSV may lower immunity and increase the risk of getting COVID-19 — for kids and adults.

"A benign peripheral nerve tumor can cause symptoms if it presses on the nerve in which it is growing or on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms, but even small tumors can sometimes cause symptoms. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and which tissues it affects. Symptoms may include:  Swelling or a lump under your skin Pain, tingling or numbness Weakness or loss of function in the affected area Dizziness or loss of balance  Causes The cause of benign peripheral nerve tumors usually isn't known. Some are passed down in families. The most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor is a schwannoma. A schwannoma typically starts in a single bundle inside the main nerve, shifting the rest of the nerve. Another common type is a neurofibroma. A neurofibroma also often forms inside the nerve. Sometimes it grows from several nerve bundles. Perineuriomas are rare and can grow from inside or outside the nerve. Tumors outside a nerve can cause problems when they press on the nerve. Other benign tumors that form outside nerves are soft lumps of slow-growing fat cells called lipomas and ganglion cysts.

"There are no specific symptoms that have been clearly linked to CTE. Some of the possible signs and symptoms of CTE can occur in many other conditions. In the few people with proved CTE, signs and symptoms have included cognitive, behavioral, mood and motor changes. CTE CTE CTE Cognitive impairment  Difficulty thinking (cognitive impairment) Memory loss Problems with planning, organization and carrying out tasks (executive function)  Behavioral changes  Impulsive behavior Aggression  Mood disorders  Depression or apathy Emotional instability Substance misuse Suicidal thoughts or behavior  Motor symptoms  Parkinsonism Motor neuron disease  CTE symptoms don't develop right after a head injury, but experts believe that they might develop over years or decades after repeated head trauma. Experts currently believe that CTE symptoms appear in two forms. In early life between the late 20s and early 30s, the first form of CTE may cause mental health and behavioral issues including depression, anxiety, impulsivity and aggression. The second form of CTE is thought to cause symptoms later in life, around age 60. These signs and symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia. CTE CTE CTE CTE The full list of signs to look for in people with CTE at autopsy is still unknown. It is unclear what kind of symptoms, if any, CTE may cause during life.

"The primary symptom of microcephaly is having a head size that is much smaller than that of other children of the same age and sex. Head size is a measure of the distance around the top of the child's head (circumference).

Some children just have small heads, with a measurement that falls below an established value for children of the same age and sex. In children with microcephaly, head size measures much smaller than average for the child's age and sex. A child with more-severe microcephaly may also have a sloping forehead.",628

"Most people who have Paget's disease of bone have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, the most common complaint is bone pain. Because this disease causes your body to generate new bone faster than normal, the rapid remodeling produces bone that's less organized and weaker than normal bone, which can lead to bone pain, deformities and fractures. The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body.  Pelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain. Skull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches. Spine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg. Leg. As the bones weaken, they may bend — causing you to become bowlegged. Enlarged and misshapen bones in your legs can put extra stress on nearby joints, which may cause osteoarthritis in your knee or hip. ",710

"Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Signs and symptoms can include:  Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells typically die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen and this causes fatigue.  Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.  Swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, increasing vulnerability to infections. Infants and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina — the portion of the eye that processes visual images — and lead to vision problems. ",907

However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period. After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include:  Fever Muscle aches Headache Severe fatigue Severe back pain Vomiting, sometimes  A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet. Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.",918

"Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis depend on the part of the body affected by excessive mast cells. Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected. Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include:  Flushing, itching or hives Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Anemia or bleeding disorders Bone and muscle pain Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating  The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. People have different triggers, but the most common ones include:  Alcohol Skin irritation Spicy foods Exercise Insect stings Certain medications  When to see a doctor When to see a doctor  Talk to your doctor if you have problems with flushing or hives, or if you have concerns about the signs or symptoms listed above. Causes Most cases of systemic mastocytosis are caused by a random change (mutation) in the KIT gene. Typically this flaw in the KIT gene is not inherited. Too many mast cells are produced and build up in tissues and body organs, releasing substances such as histamine, leukotrienes and cytokines that cause inflammation and symptoms. Complications Complications of systemic mastocytosis can include:  Anaphylactic reaction. This severe allergic reaction includes signs and symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, fainting, loss of consciousness and shock. If you have a severe allergic reaction, you may need an injection of epinephrine. Blood disorders. These can include anemia and poor blood clotting. Peptic ulcer disease. Chronic stomach irritation can lead to ulcers and bleeding in your digestive tract. Reduced bone density. Because systemic mastocytosis can affect your bones and bone marrow, you may be at risk of bone problems, such as osteoporosis. Organ failure. A buildup of mast cells in body organs can cause inflammation and damage to the organ.                   By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff  Systemic mastocytosis care at Mayo Clinic ",965

"Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease. Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include:  Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina) Shortness of breath Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed  You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.

A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains.  {Music playing} Stephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it. Who gets it? Anyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD. What are the symptoms? When coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing. How is it diagnosed? Diagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan. How is it treated? Treating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. What now? Discovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease.

Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:  Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness Fainting (syncope) or near fainting Fluttering in the chest Lightheadedness Racing heartbeat (tachycardia) Shortness of breath Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:  Pale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis) Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain  Less-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:  Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity Easily tiring during exercise or activity Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet  Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting Fatigue Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering Swollen legs, ankles or feet  Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease) The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse). Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:  Chest pain Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath Swollen feet or ankles  Endocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Endocarditis symptoms can include:  Dry or persistent cough Fever Heartbeat changes Shortness of breath Skin rashes or unusual spots Swelling of the legs or belly area Weakness or fatigue ",448

"Alcohol poisoning signs and symptoms include:  Confusion Vomiting Seizures Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute) Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths) Blue-tinged skin or pale skin Low body temperature (hypothermia) Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened  When to see a doctor It's not necessary to have all the above signs or symptoms before you seek medical help. A person with alcohol poisoning who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do:  Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side — this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness.  Don't be afraid to get help It can be difficult to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to warrant medical intervention, but it's best to err on the side of caution. You may worry about the consequences for yourself or your friend or loved one, particularly if you're underage. But the consequences of not getting the right help in time can be far more serious.",31

"Signs and symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorders you have, but may include:  Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal A blurred sense of identity Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors  There are three major dissociative disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association:  Dissociative amnesia. The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by ""switching"" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue. Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.  When to see a doctor Some people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat.

"Most people with parvovirus infection have no signs or symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they vary greatly depending on how old you are when you get the disease. Parvovirus symptoms in children Early signs and symptoms of parvovirus infection in children may include:  Fever Upset stomach Headache Runny nose  Distinctive facial rash Several days after the appearance of early symptoms, a distinctive bright red rash may appear on your child's face — usually on both cheeks. Eventually it may spread to the arms, trunk, thighs and buttocks, where the rash has a pink, lacy, slightly raised appearance. The rash may be itchy, especially on the soles of the feet. Generally, the rash occurs near the end of the illness. It's possible to mistake the rash for other viral rashes or a medicine-related rash. The rash may come and go for up to three weeks, becoming more visible when your child is exposed to extreme temperatures or spends time in the sun. Parvovirus symptoms in adults Adults don't usually develop the slapped-cheek rash. Instead, the most noticeable symptom of parvovirus infection in adults is joint soreness, lasting days to weeks. Joints most commonly affected are the hands, wrists, knees and ankles.",721

"Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place. Signs and symptoms of a retractile testicle include:  The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin. The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time. The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time.  Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum.",853

"You're more likely to have a nightmare in the second half of your night. Nightmares may occur rarely or more frequently, even several times a night. Episodes are generally brief, but they cause you to awaken, and returning to sleep can be difficult. A nightmare may involve these features:  Your dream seems vivid and real and is very upsetting, often becoming more disturbing as the dream unfolds. Your dream storyline is usually related to threats to safety or survival, but it can have other disturbing themes. Your dream awakens you. You feel scared, anxious, angry, sad or disgusted as a result of your dream. You feel sweaty or have a pounding heartbeat while in bed. You can think clearly upon awakening and can recall details of your dream. Your dream causes distress that keeps you from falling back to sleep easily.  Nightmares are only considered a disorder if you experience:  Frequent occurrences Major distress or impairment during the day, such as anxiety or persistent fear, or bedtime anxiety about having another nightmare Problems with concentration or memory, or you can't stop thinking about images from your dreams Daytime sleepiness, fatigue or low energy Problems functioning at work or school or in social situations Behavior problems related to bedtime or fear of the dark  Having a child with nightmare disorder can cause significant sleep disturbance and distress for parents or caregivers.

"You may not notice any symptoms at first. However, some women who have an ectopic pregnancy have the usual early signs or symptoms of pregnancy — a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea. If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can't continue as normal. As the fertilized egg grows in the improper place, signs and symptoms become more noticeable. Early warning of ectopic pregnancy Often, the first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, you may feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement. Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated. Emergency symptoms If the fertilized egg continues to grow in the fallopian tube, it can cause the tube to rupture. Heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely. Symptoms of this life-threatening event include extreme lightheadedness, fainting and shock.",329

"     Shedding light on dangerous faints   Click here for an infographic to learn more        Shedding light on dangerous faints   Click here for an infographic to learn more Some people with long QT syndrome (LQTS) do not have any noticeable symptoms. The condition may be discovered when an electrocardiogram (ECG) or genetic testing is done for other reasons. Fainting (syncope) is the most common symptom of long QT syndrome. A fainting spell from long QT syndrome can occur with little to no warning. Some people have fainting warning signs first, including:  Blurred vision Lightheadedness Pounding heartbeats (palpitations) Weakness  Fainting occurs when the heart temporarily beats in an unorganized way. You might faint when you're excited, angry or scared or during exercise. Things that startle you — for example, a telephone or an alarm clock — can cause you to lose consciousness. Long QT syndrome may also cause seizures in some people. Symptoms of long QT syndrome sometimes occur during sleep. Most people with symptoms of LQTS have their first episode by age 40. When the condition is present at birth (congenital long QT syndrome), symptoms may occur during the first weeks to months of life or later in childhood. LQTS Generally, after a long QT episode, the heart returns to its typical rhythm. If the heart doesn't reset itself or if an external defibrillator isn't used in time to reset the heart rhythm, sudden death will occur.",585

"Symptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe. Baby blues symptoms Symptoms of baby blues — which last only a few days to a week or two after your baby is born — may include:  Mood swings Anxiety Sadness Irritability Feeling overwhelmed Crying Reduced concentration Appetite problems Trouble sleeping  Postpartum depression symptoms Postpartum depression may be mistaken for baby blues at first — but the symptoms are more intense and last longer. These may eventually interfere with your ability to care for your baby and handle other daily tasks. Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth. But they may begin earlier — during pregnancy — or later — up to a year after birth. Postpartum depression symptoms may include:  Depressed mood or severe mood swings Crying too much Difficulty bonding with your baby Withdrawing from family and friends Loss of appetite or eating much more than usual Inability to sleep, called insomnia, or sleeping too much Overwhelming tiredness or loss of energy Less interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy Intense irritability and anger Fear that you're not a good mother Hopelessness Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy Reduced ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions Restlessness Severe anxiety and panic attacks Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby Recurring thoughts of death or suicide  Untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer. Postpartum psychosis With postpartum psychosis — a rare condition that usually develops within the first week after delivery — the symptoms are severe. Symptoms may include:  Feeling confused and lost Having obsessive thoughts about your baby Hallucinating and having delusions Having sleep problems Having too much energy and feeling upset Feeling paranoid Making attempts to harm yourself or your baby  Postpartum psychosis may lead to life-threatening thoughts or behaviors and requires immediate treatment. Postpartum depression in the other parent Studies show that new fathers can experience postpartum depression, too. They may feel sad, tired, overwhelmed, anxious, or have changes in their usual eating and sleeping patterns. These are the same symptoms that mothers with postpartum depression experience. Fathers who are young, have a history of depression, experience relationship problems or are struggling financially are most at risk of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression in fathers — sometimes called paternal postpartum depression — can have the same negative effect on partner relationships and child development as postpartum depression in mothers can. If you're a partner of a new mother and are having symptoms of depression or anxiety during your partner's pregnancy or after your child's birth, talk to your health care provider. Similar treatments and supports provided to mothers with postpartum depression can help treat postpartum depression in the other parent.",787

"Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't have any symptoms. Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't supply enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example:  If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have chest pain or pressure (angina). If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you may develop high blood pressure or kidney failure. ",69

"Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. You might experience:  Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. ",739
"Symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome often begin within a week after using injectable medications to stimulate ovulation, though sometimes it can take two weeks or longer for symptoms to appear. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may worsen or improve over time. Mild to moderate OHSS With mild to moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, symptoms can include:  Mild to moderate abdominal pain Abdominal bloating or increased waist size Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Tenderness in the area of your ovaries  Some women who use injectable fertility drugs get a mild form of OHSS. This usually goes away after about a week. But, if pregnancy occurs, symptoms of OHSS may worsen and last several days to weeks. OHSS OHSS Severe OHSS With severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, you might have:  Rapid weight gain — more than 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) in 24 hours Severe abdominal pain Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting Blood clots Decreased urination Shortness of breath Tight or enlarged abdomen ",708

"You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, you might develop:  Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters) Blurred vision Fluctuating vision Dark or empty areas in your vision Vision loss  When to see an eye doctor Careful management of your diabetes is the best way to prevent vision loss. If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor for a yearly eye exam with dilation — even if your vision seems fine. Developing diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) or having diabetes before becoming pregnant can increase your risk of diabetic retinopathy. If you're pregnant, your eye doctor might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.

"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. HIV AIDS Primary infection (Acute HIV) Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. HIV HIV Possible signs and symptoms include:  Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Diarrhea Weight loss Cough Night sweats  These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time. HIV This stage can last for many years if you're receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:  Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Pneumonia  Progression to AIDS Access to better antiviral treatments has dramatically decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide, even in resource-poor countries. Thanks to these life-saving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. AIDS HIV AIDS HIV AIDS When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. AIDS The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:  Sweats Chills Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Swollen lymph glands Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weakness Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps ",483

Common signs and symptoms of psoriasis include:  A patchy rash that varies widely in how it looks from person to person, ranging from spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions over much of the body Rashes that vary in color, tending to be shades of purple with gray scale on brown or Black skin and pink or red with silver scale on white skin Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) Dry, cracked skin that may bleed Itching, burning or soreness Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside  There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms:  Plaque psoriasis. The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin. Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles. Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic). ",822

The main symptom of impetigo is reddish sores, often around the nose and mouth. The sores quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a honey-colored crust. Sores can spread to other areas of the body through touch, clothing and towels. Itching and soreness are generally mild. A less common form of the condition called bullous impetigo causes larger blisters on the trunk of infants and young children.

You may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the symptom doesn't become a problem until it starts interfering with daily tasks. Emphysema eventually causes shortness of breath even while you're at rest. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you've had unexplained shortness of breath for several months, especially if it's getting worse or it's interfering with your daily activities. Don't ignore it by telling yourself it's because you're aging or out of shape.

"Chondrosarcoma tends to grow slowly, so it might not cause signs and symptoms at first. When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include:  Increasing pain A growing lump or area of swelling Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord  Causes It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include:  Increasing age. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age. Other bone diseases. Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body. These growths sometimes transform into chondrosarcoma.

"Signs of transposition of the great arteries may be detected during certain routine screening tests done during pregnancy. However, some people with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries may not have symptoms for many years. Signs and symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include:  Blue color of the skin (cyanosis) Shortness of breath Weak pulse Lack of appetite Poor weight gain  A blue skin color may not be as noticeable in babies who are born with transposition of the great arteries and other congenital heart defects. This is because these other heart conditions — such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus — may allow some oxygen-rich blood to travel through the body. But as the baby becomes more active, the congenital heart defects won't allow enough blood through and eventually the blue skin color will become obvious.",1006

"A cold sore usually passes through several stages:  Tingling and itching. Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters erupt. Blisters. Small fluid-filled blisters typically erupt along the border of your lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth. Oozing and crusting. The small blisters may merge and then burst, leaving shallow open sores that ooze and crust over.  Signs and symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days, and the blisters can take two to three weeks to heal completely. Recurrences typically appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak. In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience:  Fever Painful gums Sore throat Headache Muscle aches Swollen lymph nodes  Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths and the lesions are commonly mistaken for canker sores.

"Some people naturally sweat more or less than other people. Body odor also can vary from person to person. See a doctor if:  You suddenly begin to sweat much more or less than usual Sweating disrupts your daily routine You experience night sweats for no apparent reason You notice a change in your body odor  Causes Sweating and body odor are caused by sweat glands in your body. The two main types of sweat glands are eccrine glands and apocrine glands. Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of the skin. When your body temperature rises, these glands release fluids that cool your body as they evaporate. Apocrine glands are found in areas where you have hair, such as your armpits and groin. These glands release a milky fluid when you're stressed. This fluid is odorless until it combines with bacteria on your skin.

"If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves. Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to severe. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure. Mild symptoms Mild latex allergy symptoms include:  Itching Skin redness Hives or rash  More-severe symptoms These include:  Sneezing Runny nose Itchy, watery eyes Scratchy throat Difficulty breathing Wheezing Cough  Life-threatening symptoms: Anaphylaxis The most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly. An anaphylactic (an-uh-fuh-LAK-tik) reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people. However, it rarely happens the first time you're exposed. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  Difficulty breathing Hives or swelling Nausea and vomiting Wheezing Drop in blood pressure Dizziness Loss of consciousness Confusion Rapid or weak pulse ",565

"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include:  Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. Problems with planning and organizing.  Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in:  Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter.  With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because:  You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. You don't want to waste anything.  Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder. Hoarding animals People who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. Animals may be confined inside or outside. Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. The health and safety of the person and the animals are often at risk because of unsanitary conditions.",485

However, you should be able to manage normal pain with the pain reliever prescribed by your dentist or oral surgeon, and the pain should lessen with time. If you develop new or worsening pain in the days after your tooth extraction, contact your dentist or oral surgeon immediately.",313

"Breast tissue normally might feel lumpy or ropy and you may have tenderness that comes and goes with your menstrual period.  If you have an underlying breast condition, you might notice changes in how your breasts normally feel, such as:  A round, smooth and firm breast lump A large, solid-feeling lump that moves easily under your skin A hard, irregular-shaped breast lump Skin redness or dimpling like an orange Changes in breast size or shape Fluid leaking from your nipple  Causes Breast lumps can result from:  Breast cysts. If you find a breast lump that feels round, smooth and firm, it could be a cyst — a dilated milk duct filled with fluid. A breast cyst can be large or small, and the surrounding breast tissue may be tender. A breast cyst may appear before your menstrual period and get smaller or disappear afterward. Fibrocystic breast changes. With fibrocystic breast changes, you may feel fullness in your breasts with areas of lumpiness or ridgelike areas. Your breasts may feel tender. Many women experience fibrocystic breast changes related to their menstrual cycles that tend to improve after the menstrual cycle. Fibroadenomas. Fibroadenomas are solid, noncancerous breast tumors that are smooth and move easily under your skin when touched. A fibroadenoma may grow larger. Factors that may be associated with fibroadenoma growth include being pregnant, using hormone therapy or menstruation. Injuries and infections. A severe injury to your breast tissue or nearby nerves can create a breast lump. Doctors describe this condition as fat necrosis. A collection of infected fluid (abscess) in breast tissue also can cause a breast lump, one that's often associated with localized breast pain and inflammation of the skin. Breast cancer. A breast lump that's painless, hard, irregularly shaped and different from surrounding breast tissue might be breast cancer. Skin covering the lump may look red, dimpled or pitted like the skin of an orange. Your breast size and shape may change, or you may notice discharge from the nipple.  Only by seeing your doctor for evaluation can you be certain of what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have.

"Signs and symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can vary in type and severity, depending on what body systems are affected and how severe the defects are. Some signs and symptoms may be apparent at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or early childhood. Signs and symptoms may include some combination of the following:  Heart murmur and bluish skin due to poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood (cyanosis) as a result of a heart defect Frequent infections Certain facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, low-set ears, wide-set eyes or a narrow groove in the upper lip A gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or other problems with the palate Delayed growth Difficulty feeding, failure to gain weight or gastrointestinal problems Breathing problems Poor muscle tone Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech Learning delays or disabilities Behavior problems  When to see a doctor Other conditions may cause signs and symptoms similar to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. So it's important to get an accurate and prompt diagnosis if your child shows any signs or symptoms listed above. Doctors may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:   At birth. If certain conditions — a severe heart defect, cleft palate or a combination of other factors typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome — are readily apparent at birth, diagnostic tests will likely begin before your child leaves the hospital. At well-baby visits. Your family doctor or pediatrician may suspect the disorder because of a combination of illnesses or disorders that become apparent over time. Other issues may come to the attention of your doctor during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups for your child. ",295

A salmon-pink rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on your trunk, arms or legs. Sore throat. This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still's disease. The lymph nodes in your neck might be swollen and tender. Achy and swollen joints. Your joints — especially your knees and wrists — might be stiff, painful and inflamed.

"The main sign of FAP is hundreds or even thousands of polyps growing in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your mid-teens. The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s. Causes Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent. But some people develop the abnormal gene that causes the condition. Risk factors Your risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or sister with the condition.                   Complications In addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications:  Duodenal polyps. These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Periampullary polyps. These polyps occur where the bile and pancreas ducts enter the duodenum (ampulla). Periampullary polyps might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Gastric fundic polyps. These polyps grow in the lining of your stomach. Desmoids. These noncancerous masses can arise anywhere in the body but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen). Desmoids can cause serious problems if they grow into nerves or blood vessels or exert pressure on other organs in your body. Other cancers. Rarely, FAP can cause cancer to develop in your thyroid gland, central nervous system, adrenal glands, liver or other organs. Noncancerous (benign) skin tumors. Benign bone growths (osteomas). Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). These are benign pigment changes in the retina of your eye. Dental abnormalities. These include extra teeth or teeth that don't come in. Low numbers of red blood cells (anemia).  Prevention Preventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition. However, if you or your child is at risk of FAP because of a family member with the condition, you will need genetic testing and counseling. If you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed. Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications.

"Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection. When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses — such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms:  Headache Muscle, bone or joint pain Nausea Vomiting Pain behind the eyes Swollen glands Rash  Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include:  Severe stomach pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding from your gums or nose Blood in your urine, stools or vomit Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising Difficult or rapid breathing Fatigue Irritability or restlessness ",276

A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area An enlarged lymph node in the neck Extremely red eyes without a thick discharge Red, dry, cracked lips and an extremely red, swollen tongue Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, with later peeling of skin on fingers and toes  The symptoms might not occur at the same time, so it's important to let your child's health care provider know about a sign or symptom that has gone away. Other signs and symptoms that might develop include:  Abdominal pain Diarrhea Irritability Joint pain Vomiting  Children with a high fever for five or more days who have fewer than four of the above signs and symptoms might have what's known as incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of coronary artery injury and still require treatment within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. Kawasaki disease can have symptoms similar to that of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which has occurred worldwide in children with COVID-19.

"With a peripheral nerve injury, you may experience symptoms that range from mild to seriously limiting your daily activities. Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged:  Motor nerves. These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. Damage to these nerves is typically associated with muscle weakness, painful cramps and uncontrollable muscle twitching. Sensory nerves. Because these nerves relay information about touch, temperature and pain, you may experience a variety of symptoms. These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. You may have trouble sensing pain or changes in temperature, walking, keeping your balance with your eyes closed, or fastening buttons. Autonomic (aw-tuh-NOM-ik) nerves. This group of nerves regulates activities that are not controlled consciously, such as breathing, heart and thyroid function, and digesting food. Symptoms may include excessive sweating, changes in blood pressure, the inability to tolerate heat and gastrointestinal symptoms.  You may experience a range of symptoms because many peripheral nerve injuries affect more than one type of nerve fiber.",742

"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:  Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice  Patterns of behavior A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:  Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture  As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems.",87

"The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:  Pain. While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap. Swelling. Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee. Stiffness. You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps. Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash. In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings.  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features. Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal.",546
"Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:  Blackheads. Blackheads appear in small pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs. Painful pea-sized lumps. The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. Leaking bumps or sores. Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. Tunnels. Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.  Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable.

"Signs and symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder and can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would normally be expected in response to a stressful event, and the stress causes significant problems in your life. Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world and may also affect your actions or behavior. Some examples include:  Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy Frequent crying Worrying or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out Trouble sleeping Lack of appetite Difficulty concentrating Feeling overwhelmed Difficulty functioning in daily activities Withdrawing from social supports Avoiding important things such as going to work or paying bills Suicidal thoughts or behavior  Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event and last no longer than 6 months after the end of the stressful event. However, persistent or chronic adjustment disorders can continue for more than 6 months, especially if the stressor is ongoing, such as unemployment. When to see a doctor Usually stressors are temporary, and we learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder get better because the stress has eased. But sometimes the stressful event remains a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. Talk to your doctor if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. If you have concerns about your child's adjustment or behavior, talk with your child's pediatrician. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat.

"Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include:  Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't Difficulty handling uncertainty Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision Inability to set aside or let go of a worry Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank""  Physical signs and symptoms may include:  Fatigue Trouble sleeping Muscle tension or muscle aches Trembling, feeling twitchy Nervousness or being easily startled Sweating Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome Irritability  There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age. Symptoms in children and teenagers Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about:  Performance at school or sporting events Family members' safety Being on time (punctuality) Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events  A child or teen with excessive worry may:  Feel overly anxious to fit in Be a perfectionist Redo tasks because they aren't perfect the first time Spend excessive time doing homework Lack confidence Strive for approval Require a lot of reassurance about performance Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints Avoid going to school or avoid social situations  When to see a doctor Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if:  You feel like you're worrying too much, and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — seek emergency treatment immediately  Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe — it may be easier to treat early on.",408

"The main symptom of transient global amnesia is being unable to create new memories and remember the recent past. Once that symptom is confirmed, ruling out other possible causes of amnesia is important. You must have these signs and symptoms to be diagnosed with transient global amnesia:  Sudden onset of confusion that includes memory loss, seen by a witness Being awake and alert and knowing who you are, despite memory loss Normal cognition, such as the ability to recognize and name familiar objects and follow simple directions No signs of damage to a particular area of the brain, such as being unable to move an arm or leg, movements you can't control, or problems understanding words  More symptoms and history that may help diagnose transient global amnesia:  Symptoms lasting no more than 24 hours and generally shorter Gradual return of memory No recent head injury No signs of seizures during the period of amnesia No history of active epilepsy  Another common sign of transient global amnesia due to the inability to create new memories includes repetitive questioning, usually of the same question — for example, ""What am I doing here?"" or ""How did we get here?""",1004
"Persistent and recurrent episodes of depersonalization or derealization or both cause distress and problems functioning at work or school or in other important areas of your life. During these episodes, you are aware that your sense of detachment is only a feeling and not reality. The experience and feelings of the disorder can be difficult to describe. Worry about ""going crazy"" can cause you to become preoccupied with checking that you exist and determining what's actually real. Symptoms usually begin in the mid- to late teens or early adulthood. Depersonalization-derealization disorder is rare in children and older adults. Depersonalization symptoms Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're an outside observer of your thoughts, feelings, your body or parts of your body — for example, as if you were floating in air above yourself Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of your speech or movements The sense that your body, legs or arms appear distorted, enlarged or shrunken, or that your head is wrapped in cotton Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you A sense that your memories lack emotion, and that they may or may not be your own memories  Derealization symptoms Symptoms of derealization include: Feelings of being alienated from or unfamiliar with your surroundings — for example, like you're living in a movie or a dream Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings Distortions in perception of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects  Episodes of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or even months at a time. In some people, these episodes turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may periodically get better or worse.",277

"Most people infected with ascariasis have no signs or symptoms. Moderate to heavy infestations cause various signs or symptoms, depending on which part of your body is affected. In the lungs After you swallow the tiny (microscopic) ascariasis eggs, they hatch in the small intestine and the larvae migrate through the bloodstream or lymphatic system into the lungs. At this stage, you may experience signs and symptoms similar to asthma or pneumonia, including:  Persistent cough Shortness of breath Wheezing  After spending 10 to 14 days in the lungs, the larvae travel to the throat, where you cough them up and then swallow them. In the intestines The larvae mature into adult worms in the small intestine, and the adult worms typically live in the intestines until they die. In mild or moderate ascariasis, the intestinal infestation can cause:  Vague abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or bloody stools  If you have a large number of worms in the intestine, you might have:  Severe abdominal pain Fatigue Vomiting Weight loss or malnutrition A worm in your vomit or stool  ",74

"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:  A shiny, skin-colored bump that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly patch with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.

"Children The first sign of intussusception in an otherwise healthy infant may be sudden, loud crying caused by belly pain. Infants who have belly pain may pull their knees to their chests when they cry. The pain of intussusception comes and goes, usually every 15 to 20 minutes at first. These painful episodes last longer and happen more often as time passes. Other symptoms of intussusception include:  Stool mixed with blood and mucus — sometimes referred to as currant jelly stool because of its appearance. Vomiting. A lump in the belly. Weakness or lack of energy. Diarrhea.  Not everyone has all of the symptoms. Some infants have no obvious pain. Some children don't pass blood or have a lump in the belly. And some older children have pain but no other symptoms. Adults Intussusception is rare in adults. Also, because symptoms of the disorder often overlap with the symptoms of other disorders, it's more challenging to identify. The most common symptom is belly pain that comes and goes. Nausea and vomiting also may occur. People sometimes have symptoms for weeks before seeking medical attention. ",534

Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.",942

"Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person. Intrusive memories Intrusive memories Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:  Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks) Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event  Avoidance Avoidance Symptoms of avoidance may include:  Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event  Negative changes in thinking and mood Negative changes in thinking and mood Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:  Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world Hopelessness about the future Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event Difficulty maintaining close relationships Feeling detached from family and friends Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed Difficulty experiencing positive emotions Feeling emotionally numb  Changes in physical and emotional reactions Changes in physical and emotional reactions Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:  Being easily startled or frightened Always being on guard for danger Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast Trouble sleeping Trouble concentrating Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior Overwhelming guilt or shame  For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include:  Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event  Intensity of symptoms Intensity of symptoms PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.

In general, cancer begins when cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains instructions that tell a cell what to do. The DNA mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly, creating many abnormal cells. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the mutations cause too many abnormal T cells that attack the skin. T cells are part of your immune system, and they normally help your body fight germs. Doctors don't know why the cells attack the skin.

It appears as a painless, flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule growing on your skin. Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Basal cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face. Basal cell carcinoma may appear as:  A pearly or waxy bump A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns  Squamous cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as:  A firm, red nodule A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface  Melanoma signs and symptoms Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. Melanoma signs include:  A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black A painful lesion that itches or burns Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus  Signs and symptoms of less common skin cancers Other, less common types of skin cancer include:  Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage.  Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. Sebaceous gland carcinoma. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems. ",910
